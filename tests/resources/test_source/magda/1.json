Zero values indicate erosional terrain with values 1 and larger indicating progressively larger areas of deposition. There is some evidence that MrVBF values correlate with depth of deposited material.\n\n\n\nThe MrVBF product was derived from the Smoothed Digital Elevation Model (DEM-S; ANZCW0703014016), which is based on the 1 second resolution SRTM data acquired by NASA in February 2000.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nThe 1 second SRTM-derived Smoothed Digital Elevation Model (DEM-S; ANZCW0703014016).\n\n\n\nMrVBF calculation\n\nThe MrVBF method is described in Gallant and Dowling (2003). It is based on slope and position in landscape (ranking within a 3- or 6-cell circular window) calculated from the original DEM and progressively generalised DEMs. The algorithm used to create this product is version 6g-a5, which is slightly different to that in the original paper.\n\n\n\nEach value of MrVBF is associated with a particular scale and slope threshold. For each successive value the slope threshold halves and the scale triples. At each scale a location is considered erosional if it is high (ranked above the majority of the surrounding cells) or steep (slope greater than the threshold), and depositional otherwise. The largest value takes precedence at each location, so a value of zero indicates the site is considered to be erosional at all scales.\n\n\n\nValue    Threshold    Resolution      Interpretation\n\n         slope (%)    (approx)\n\n  0                      30 m         Erosional\n\n  1        16            30           Small hillside deposit\n\n  2         8            30           Narrow valley floor\n\n  3         4            90\n\n  4         2           270           Valley floor\n\n  5         1           800           Extensive valley floor\n\n  6         0.5         2.4 km\n\n  7         0.25        7.2 km        Depositional basin\n\n  8         0.125        22 km\n\n  9         0.0625       66 km        Extensive depositional basin\n\n\n\nMrVBF has been used with topographic wetness index (TWI) to predict soil depths; see McKenzie, Gallant and Gregory (2003) for details.\n\n\n\nThe MrVBF calculation was performed on 1&#xB0; &#xf0b4; 1&#xB0; tiles, with overlaps to ensure correct values at tile edges, for the finer scale steps (1 through 3). The coarser scale steps use lower resolution data so could be processed for the entire continent as a single piece, starting with a generalised version of DEM-S at 9 second resolution. The tiled processing clipped out the relevant parts of the 9 second results and combined them with the finer scale results from the 1 second DEM-S.\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nCSIRO (2016) AUS SRTM 1sec MRVBF mosaic v01.

Department of the Environment, Bureau of Meteorology, CSIRO and Geoscience Australia, Australia. http://data.bioregionalassessments.gov.au/product/NSB/GLO/2.6.2.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nThis dataset contains all the scripts to carry out the uncertainty analysis for the maximum drawdown and time to maximum drawdown at the groundwater receptors associated with the Avon and Karuah alluvia and all the resulting posterior predictions. This is described in product 2.6.2 Groundwater numerical modelling (Peeters et al. 2016).\n\n\n\nThe file 'GLO_MF_dmax_UA_workflow.pptx' shows a diagram of the workflow of the uncertainty analysis for the Avon model. The workflow for the Karuah uncertainty analysis is identical. Avon specific files have '_g_' in the filename. Karuah specific files have '_k_' in the filename.\n\n\n\nThe post-processed results from the numerical modelling (dataset GLO MF Model v02) are summarised in files 'GLO_MF_karuah_budget_m3d.csv', 'GLO_MF_gloc_budget_m3d.csv', 'GLO_MF_dmax_g_DoE_Predictions.csv' and ''GLO_MF_dmax_g_DoE_Predictions.csv' . \n\n\n\nPython script 'GLO_MF_dmax_Predictions.py' creates input files for the uncertainty analysis:\n\n- 'GLO_MF_dmax_g_Predictions.csv': summary of the maximum drawdown (dmax) predictions at the receptors - Name, Transform, Emulate, Min, Max, Median\n\n- 'GLO_MF_tmax_g_Predictions.csv': summary of the time to maximum drawdown (tmax)  predictions at the receptors - Name, Transform, Emulate, Min, Max, Median\n\n- 'GLO_MF_sumstat.csv': summary of the summary statistics to constrain the models - Name, Transform, Emulate, Min, Max, Median\n\n- 'GLO_AEM_dmax_DoE_Predictions.csv': simulated maximum drawdown values at receptor locations corresponding to the parameter combinations in 'GLO_DoE_Parameters.csv'\n\n- 'GLO_AEM_tmax_DoE_Predictions.csv': simulated time to maximum drawdown values at receptor locations corresponding to the parameter combinations in 'GLO_DoE_Parameters.csv'\n\n- 'GLO_sumstat_DoE.csv': summary statistics to constrain the models corresponding to the parameter combinations in 'GLO_DoE_Parameters.csv'\n\n\n\nFile 'GLO_DoE_Parameters.csv' contains the 10.000 parameter combinations used in the design of experiment, generated with the maximin latin hypercube sampling.\n\n\n\nFile 'GLO_MF_dmax_Parameters.csv' contains information on the parameters of the Avon and Karuah MODFLOW model that are varied in the uncertainty analysis. This is the name, transform, minimum, maximum, description, the type of prior distribution, the first and second moments of the prior distribution and the covariance. These values are specified by the modelling team and described in section 2.6.2.6 in Peeters et al. (2016).\n\n\n\nThe script 'GLO_MF_SensitivityAnalysis.py' calculates the Plischke et al (2013) sensitivity index for all HRV-receptor-parameter combination, which are stored in files 'GLO_MF_dmax_SI.csv', 'GLO_MF_tmax_SI.csv' and 'GLO_MF_sumstat_SI.csv'.\n\n\n\nFor each prediction of tmax and dmax an emulator is created with R-scripts 'GLO_MF_dmax_g_Emulate_pred_i.R' and 'GLO_MF_dmax_g_Emulate_pred_i.R'. The script uses the R-scripts in dataset 'R-scripts for uncertainty analysis v01' and stores an R data object with extension .Rdata in subdirectory 'emulators/predictionname'.\n\n\n\nThe R script 'GLO_MF_dmax_CreatePosteriorParameters.R' performs the Approximate Bayesian Computation Markov Chain Monte Carlo to constrain the prior parameter distributions with an acceptance criterion based on the historical water balance of the alluvial system. This model result is summarised in file 'GLO_sumstat.csv' and all results of the design of experiment are stored in 'GLO_sumstat_DoE.csv'. The script results in an emulator object (file '\\emulator\\glo_sumstat\\glo_sumstat.RData') and a spreadsheet with 10.000 posterior parameter combinations (file 'GLO_MF_dmax_g_Posterior_Parameters.csv'). The first 200 of these parameter combinations are used to generate the output for interpolation of exceedance probabilities in dataset GLO MF Model v02.\n\n\n\nThe R scripts 'GLO_MF_tmax_g_MCsampler_pred_i.R' and 'GLO_MF_dmax_g_MCsampler_pred_i.R' use the emulators for each prediction to sample the posterior parameters to create the posterior predictive ensembles, which are stored for each prediction separately in '\\emulators\\predname_prediction.csv'\n\n\n\nPost-processing scripts 'GLO_MF_dmax_Postprocess_Predictions.py' and 'GLO_MF_tmax_Postprocess_Predictions.py' combine these individual files into two posterior prediction files: 'GLO_MF_dmax_Posterior_Predictions.csv' and 'GLO_MF_tmax_Posterior_Predictions.csv'. These have the combined predictions at the receptor locations of both the Karuah and Avon alluvial MODFLOW models.\n\n\n\nThese files are further summarised in exceedance probabilities with script 'GLO_MF_probabilities.py', which outputs files 'GLO_MF_dmax_ExceedanceProbabilities.csv' and 'GLO_MF_tmax_ExceedanceProbabilities.csv'\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\nPeeters L, Dawes W, Rachakonda P, Pagendam D, Singh R, Pickett T, Frery E, Marvanek S, and McVicar T (2016) Groundwater numerical modelling for the Gloucester subregion.

The source datasets are identified in the Lineage field in this metadata statement. The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement.\n\n\n\nThese 'ghost' model node points are duplicates of the primary surface water model nodes. The 'ghost' nodes are located on the blue line stream network used to represent the riverine landscape classes and the primary model nodes are located on the BA-standard Geofabric Network blue line network. The ghost nodes are placed according to the following rule set (1) the primary sw model node is on the Geofabric Network blue line (2) keep the ghost node within the same catchment as the primary node (3) keep the ghost node within the same assessment unit as the primary node. \n\nThe purpose of the ghost nodes are to enable replication of the surface water modelling results across differently mapped blue line networks of the same physical rivers. In this case, from the BA-standard blue line stream network (Geofabric Network streams v2) to the riverine landscape class blue line.\n\n\n\nThis dataset differsr from previous versions in that they did not include nodes 31 - 34. These are now included and equate to stream gauges as follows:\n\nnode 31 = gauge 208006\n\nnode 32 = gauge 208020\n\nnode 33 = gauge 209002\n\nnode 34 = gauge 209018\n\n\n\nNote that Node 31 is outside the Gloucester Analyses extent and therefor does not have an AU_id.\n\n## **Purpose** \n\nThe purpose of the ghost nodes are to enable replication of the surface water modelling results across differently mapped blue line networks of the same physical rivers. In this case, from the BA-standard blue line stream network (Geofabric Network streams v2) to the riverine landscape class blue line. THis enable direct use of the surface water modelling in the impact analysis component of hte BA.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nThese 'ghost' model node points are duplicates of the primary surface water model nodes.

This dataset was derived from a NSW Office of Water dataset. You can find a link to the parent dataset in the Lineage Field in this metadata statement. The History Field in this metadata statement describes how this dataset was derived.\n\n\n\nThis polygon dataset shows the Water Source Area boundaries for the Catchment areas that intersect with the Gloucester subregion. Boundaries were extracted from the NSW Water Sharing Plan (WSP) database (see lineage), and dissolved on the \"WATER_SOURCE\" field.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nPolygons from the data set \"NSW Office of Water combined geodatabase of regulated rivers and water sharing plan regions\" were selected based on their intersection with river catchments intersected with the Gloucester subregion boundary. These selected polygons were then DISSOLVEd on the \"WATER_SOURCE\" field. The Fields \"Basin\" and \"Map_Label\" were added and attributed as required to facilitate selective map display, symbology, labeling etc. for report maps images.\n\n## **Dataset Citation** \n\nBioregional Assessment Programme (XXXX) GLO Catchments Water Source Boundaries.
