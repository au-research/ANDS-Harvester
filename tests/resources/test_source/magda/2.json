The source datasets are identified in the Lineage field in this metadata statement. The processes undertaken to produce this derived dataset are described in the History field in this metadata statement.\n\n\n\nThese 'ghost' model node points are duplicates of the primary surface water model nodes. The 'ghost' nodes are located on the blue line stream network used to represent the riverine landscape classes and the primary model nodes are located on the BA-standard Geofabric Network blue line network. The ghost nodes are placed according to the following rule set (1) the primary sw model node is on the Geofabric Network blue line (2) keep the ghost node within the same catchment as the primary node (3) keep the ghost node within the same assessment unit as the primary node. \n\nThe purpose of the ghost nodes are to enable replication of the surface water modelling results across differently mapped blue line networks of the same physical rivers. In this case, from the BA-standard blue line stream network (Geofabric Network streams v2) to the riverine landscape class blue line.\n\n\n\nThis dataset differsr from previous versions in that they did not include nodes 31 - 34. These are now included and equate to stream gauges as follows:\n\nnode 31 = gauge 208006\n\nnode 32 = gauge 208020\n\nnode 33 = gauge 209002\n\nnode 34 = gauge 209018\n\n\n\nNote that Node 31 is outside the Gloucester Analyses extent and therefor does not have an AU_id.\n\n## **Purpose** \n\nThe purpose of the ghost nodes are to enable replication of the surface water modelling results across differently mapped blue line networks of the same physical rivers. In this case, from the BA-standard blue line stream network (Geofabric Network streams v2) to the riverine landscape class blue line. THis enable direct use of the surface water modelling in the impact analysis component of hte BA.\n\n## **Dataset History** \n\nThese 'ghost' model node points are duplicates of the primary surface water model nodes.
