It is important to note that these numbers may fluctuate as new complainants come forward, more Traffic Infringement Notices are downloaded into the system, or when complaints are withdrawn.\r\n\r\nIt should also be noted that the individual geographical areas will not combine to the ACT totals due to the exclusion of rural sectors and other regions.\r\n\r\nIt is important for the community to understand there may be a straight-forward explanation for a spike in offences in their neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nFor example, sexual offences in Narrabundah increased from two in the January to March last year, to 32 in the first quarter of 2012. These 32 sexual offences relate to one historical case which was reported to police in January 2012, and which has since been finalised.\r\n\r\nThe smaller the number of reported offences involved, the greater the chance for a dramatic percentage increase.",

As an example: driving from home to a park and ride facility, then catching a bus to an interchange, then walking to a shop to purchase an item and finally walking to work is comprised of 4 \u2018stops\u2019 and two \u2018trips\u2019. \n\nNote: This data represents travel and activity on an average weekday, and average times include wait times at transport interchanges. The main method of travel across a trip is used to classify trip types. The time of day is based on the mid-point of the start and arrival time of the trip. \nAM Peak: 8-9AM, PM Peak: 5-6PM",

The API documentation is available at https://api.smartparking.com/Help?Version=1 . The <sitecode> referred to in the help documentation will be AUACTCC01 .\tEnsure you use https and not http.  \r\n\r\nThe SmartLot API v1 lets you query for most locations and returns Lot details, Lot operating hours, Lot tariffs, Lot occupancies, and Unavailable bays.\r\nThe APIs are RESTful; they are URLs with parameters submitted via HTTP. How the API responds is dependent on the URL string that is used, and the content of your HTTP request header. The URL query string dictates the specific API operations. The APIs provide two different ways to get the data back to you, XML and JSON.\r\n",
