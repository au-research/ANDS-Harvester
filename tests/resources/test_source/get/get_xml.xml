				                            national evaluation of the quality of research – showed that over 86 per
				                            cent of our assessed research is at or above world-class standard. In
				                            several areas our research is performing well above world-class levels,
				                            a significant achievement given our short history as a

         <description type="full"> &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Dr Siobhan Banks is currently a Senior
				                            Research Fellow in the Centre for Sleep Research. After receiving her
				                            Ph.D. in 2004 from Flinders University of South Australia, she trained
				                            at the Adelaide Institute for Sleep Health, before moving to the
				                            University of Pennsylvania to pursue her research interests in the
				                            neurobehavioral consequences of sleep loss. Initially a postdoctoral
				                            researcher, supervised by Professor David Dinges, she joined the
				                            University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine faculty as an Assistant
				                            Professor of Sleep in Psychiatry in 2006. While in the US Siobhan was a
				                            co-investigator on several grants primarily focused on the effects of
				                            sleep loss on performance and health. Additionally, she was an
				                            investigator on two National Space Biomedical Research Institute (NASA)
				                            funded projects, one aimed at determining optimal sleep-wake schedules
				                            with restricted sleep and recovery sleep opportunities, and the other
				                            investigating unobtrusive ways to measure performance stress using
				                            optical computer recognition algorithms applied to video of facial
				                            features. In 2009 Siobhan moved back to Australia with a research
				                            fellowship from the University of South Australia to continue her
				                            studies into the effects of sleep loss on health and neurobehavioral
				                            performance.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; </description>

				                            Director of the Nutritional Physiology Research Centre at the University
				                            of South Australia and Deputy Editor-in-Chief of the journal Nutrients.
				                            Jon's research interests focus on the effects of diet and exercise on
				                            health and physical function in populations ranging from patient groups
				                            to elite athletes. His research has led to 10 patent applications (2
				                            granted, 8 pending) for novel foods and other technologies for improving
				                            health and athletic performance. His work has also contributed to
				                            changes in international food policy. </description>

         <description type="full" xml:lang="en"> Professor Peter Majewski joined
				                            UniSA in January 2003 as Bioinnovation SA Professorial Fellow at the Ian
				                            Wark Research Institute before he moved on to the professor position on
				                            Nanotechnology and Nanomanufacturing in the School of Advanced
				                            Manufacturing and Mechanical Engineering, Mawson Institute, in January
				                            2008. He is mineralogist by training and has focused his research work
				                            mainly on nanomaterials synthesis and processing as well as
				                            nanomanufacturing. Born in Germany, he studied geology at University of
				                            Hannover, Germany, and received Diploma (4-year course) in 1985. He
				                            immediately started his PhD work on cation diffusion in silicates at the
				                            University of Hannover. In 1988, he received PhD in Mineralogy at the
				                            University of Hannover. In 1989, he joined the Max-Planck-Institute for
				                            Metals Research (MPI-MF), Department of Materials Synthesis and
				                            Microstructure Design (Powdermetallurgical Laboratory) as post doctoral
				                            fellow. His main research work was part of a long-term initiative of the
				                            Max-Planck-Institute along with other university institutes and the
				                            companies Hoechst AG, Siemens AG, and Vacuumschmelze on the development
				                            of high temperature superconducting cables and devices. In 1992, he
				                            received the Heinz Maier Leibnitz award of the Department of Education
				                            and Science of the Federal Government of Germany for his fundamental
				                            studies on the phase relations and synthesis of novel ceramic
				                            superconductors. After several renewals, the program, which was
				                            supported by the German government, ended in 2001. At that time, Peter
				                            already became senior scientist as well as deputy department head of the
				                            Department ‘Materials Synthesis and Microstructure Design’. In addition
				                            to that, he already has switched is focus to the Solid Oxide Fuel Cells.
				                            In 1998, he has set up an interdisciplinary cooperation between the
				                            MPI-MF and the Research Centre Juelich, and the German Centre for Air
				                            and Space Travel Stuttgart (DLR) on the synthesis and characterization
				                            of novel electrode and electrolyte materials for solid oxide fuel cells,
				                            which was funded by the German government. In 2000, he received the
				                            International Research Exchange Scheme Award of the Australian Research
				                            Council. In the frame of this award, he joined the Faculty of
				                            Engineering of the University of Wollongong as an International
				                            Professor Fellow, for several months during the years 2001 and 2002. At

				                            at the Centre for Regional Engagement, located in UniSA's Whyalla
				                            Campus. Professor Newbury has undertaken substantial empirically based
				                            research, using a variety of quantitative and qualitative methodologies.
				                            His MD thesis was a randomised controlled trial of preventive Health
				                            Assessment of the people aged 75 years and over (75+HA). This research
				                            work included GP supervision of nurses providing home assessments was
				                            the Australian evidence base for the introduction of the Enhanced
				                            Primary Care policy and the Medicare item number for 75+HA.
				                            Internationally this evidence is included in the latest systematic
				                            review and meta-analysis of preventive aged care in primary health care.
				                            His work in rural medical education has been part of the Australian
				                            governments Rural Health Strategy. While this is starting to deliver a
				                            new rural health workforce this is no longer seen as the only solution
				                            to adequate health workforce for rural and indigenous Australia. Hence
				                            his future research is directed to models of health service delivery in
				                            communities in partnership with Country Health SA. Through the
				                            development of these roles Professor Newbury brings an in-depth
				                            understanding of the relationships between clinical service delivery of
				                            primary health care and primary health care policy, especially in the
				                            areas of multi disciplinary practice and training, and workforce

         <description type="full" xml:lang="en"> Tim Olds is a Professor of Health
				                            Sciences at the University of South Australia. After completing a PhD in
				                            French Studies at the University of Sydney, Tim went on to study
				                            exercise science, receiving a second PhD in 1997. His research interests
				                            have been in mathematical modelling of cycling performance,
				                            anthropometry, and secular trends in the fitness, fatness, physical
				                            activity and food intake. He was Project Director for the Australian
				                            National Nutrition and Physical Activity Survey, and for the ADAPT
				                            Project, which used 3D anthropometry to match body types with military
				                            aircraft. Tim's current work looks at how people use their time,
				                            especially when undertaking behavioural change programs. </description>

				                            physicist with complementary training in numerical analysis. His PhD
				                            work was on modelling nucleation and growth of clusters on surfaces in
				                            the early stages (submonolayer regime) of homoepitaxial Molecular Beam
				                            Epitaxy (MBE). During a short postdoc (June-December 2000) at Emory
				                            University, he investigated the use of conformal mapping techniques in
				                            problems related to diffusion limited aggregation. In 2001 he moved to
				                            the Max-Planck-Institute for Metal Research, Stuttgart, Germany, joining
				                            as a research scientist the department of "Inhomogeneous Condensed
				                            Matter" lead by Prof. Dr. Rer. Nat. Siegrfried Dietrich. The
				                            research in Stuttgart focused on microscopic models for the dynamics of
				                            monolayer films, with a view on applications connected with
				                            nano-fluidics, and on the theoretical description of reactive adsorbates
				                            on catalyst-decorated substrates. Mihail joined the Ian Wark Research
				                            Institute at the UniSA in 2007.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; </description>

         <description type="full" xml:lang="en"> Professor Clive Prestidge is a
				                            physical chemist who specialises in fundamental and applied aspects of
				                            colloid and interface science. Clive's PhD from Bristol University was
				                            concerned with polymers at interfaces, in particular the application of
				                            FTIR to determine adsorbed polymer conformations. He joined the
				                            University of South Australia in 1990 as a post-doctoral fellow to
				                            investigate the colloid and surface properties of minerals, particularly
				                            applications to sulphide mineral flotation and alumina crystallization.
				                            During the late 90's Clive developed a strong interest in the
				                            application of colloid and interfacial chemistry to pharmaceutical
				                            delivery systems and has subsequently developed this area within the Ian
				                            Wark Research Institute and through a number of national and
				                            international collaborations. Clive is currently a Research Professor
				                            and Associate Director: Nanomedicine at The Wark and leads research
				                            teams with a primary focus on nano-structured drug delivery systems and
				                            interfacial science applied to pharmaceutical formulation and delivery.

				                            Institute (SAHMRI), the School brings together a mix of researchers
				                            including international leaders in social and spatial epidemiology,
				                            biostatistics, psychometrics and measurement, public health, health
				                            promotion and disease prevention, and health economics. Researchers and
				                            higher degree research students within the School will collaborate
				                            broadly with SAHMRI researchers within themes such as Indigenous health,
				                            cancer and cardiovascular disease. Research will centre on the analysis
				                            of complex population-level data to inform health and social policy, and
				                            the scientific logic and methods required for the development,
				                            implementation and evaluation of interventions to improve community
				                            health and well-being. The School will conduct service teaching across
				                            the Division in areas including population health, health promotion and
				                            public health. It is developing an accredited Master of Public Health
				                            and evolving a novel doctoral training program combining rigorous
				                            training in population health methodology with original research on
				                            contemporary health challenges. Students within the School will be
				                            exposed to innovative programs where research results are disseminated
				                            in real time to community leaders including local councils and policy
				                            makers, for use in planning and implementing health and social policy
				                            changes to support healthful living, and positive community-level
				                            opportunities and resources, for all.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; </description>

         <description type="full" xml:lang="en"> Professor Linda Zou received her PhD
				                            in chemistry from Monash University (1998). Her main research
				                            contributions are in the fields of novel nanomaterials synthesis,
				                            including ordered mesoporous carbons, conductive graphene nano-sheets
				                            and visible light sensitive TiO2/prorous adsorbent nano-composites, and
				                            their application to solve “real world” problems, in desalination and
				                            water purification. In desalination research, Dr Zou has focused on
				                            applying nanotechnology in low energy alternative desalination methods.
				                            Her contribution in developing novel carbons electrode materials in
				                            capacitive deionisation process has achieved greatly improved electrode
				                            efficiency and is received recognition internationally. Her recent
				                            research work involves on developing novel membrane surfaces for low
				                            biofouling. From 2000 until now, Professor Linda Zou has been successful
				                            in receiving ten national competitive ARC grants and National Centre of
				                            Excellence in Desalination (NCED) grants. She currently leads one
				                            Discovery project and three NCED funded research projects. Her research
				                            outcomes have been well published on peer reviewed international
				                            journals and she is a regular presenter at prestige International Water
				                            Association Conferences. She is the main inventor of one international
				                            patent and three provisional patents, and has attracted substantial
				                            funding for industrial related R &amp; D. </description>

These sands are to be used in water treatment to help remove undesirable contaminants, such as humic acid. The influences of treatment time and plasma polymerisation settings were investigated by ToF-SIMS, by measuring the distribution and intensity of the plasma polymer signal. This could then be correlated to the best conditions to use when designing a low cost water treatment system.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>

				                            Population Health (SPH). The Whyalla Intergenerational Study of Health
				                            (WISH) is a study involving approximately 1200 adults and 300 children.
				                            The project is specifically designed to estimate the prevalence of
				                            chronic disease and associated risk factors in Whyalla, South Australia.
				                            It highlights health-priority areas where the Whyalla Community is doing
				                            well and where knowledge and strategies still need to be developed to
				                            improve health and wellbeing across the community.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; </description>

         <description type="brief" xml:lang="en"> Max was born in 1917 and he
				                            attended the Westbourne Park Primary School. His education at the
				                            Goodwood Technical School was interrupted after only two years by the
				                            Depression. Max did a course in 'Practical Building - Supervisory
				                            Management' which gave him an Unrestricted Builder's License. Later he
				                            did a two-year course in architecture through the International
				                            Correspondence School (South Australia). This was schooling by
				                            correspondence for those people who had been unable to finish their
				                            education due to the Depression or World War II. The standards they set
				                            were very high but Max excelled in his work with them despite having to
				                            earn a living at the same time. During WW2 (1940-1944) he worked in the
				                            drawing office at General Motors Holdens, to become a staff Senior of
				                            the section involved. After the War, in 1944, he began work as a
				                            builder. He worked on jobs in Adelaide suburban and in rural areas of
				                            South Australia. In 1954 he was employed as an Earthquake Assessor by
				                            the London Insurance Co (Adelaide) and made all decisions re assessment
				                            on any claims lodged. In 1955 he answered an advertisement for the
				                            manager of the Adelaide office for Frank Humphreys who was an architect
				                            in Melbourne setting up a print media service to home builders around
				                            Australia through The Women's Weekly Home Plans Service based at Grace
				                            Bros, Broadway, NSW. Out of 55 people who applied, Max got the job. Mail
				                            Order plans were sold as 'standard' (as presented in the booklets or the
				                            papers), to a client's own design, or modified to suit any block or
				                            location. By 1957 he was writing for the print media (Sunday newspapers)
				                            throughout Australia on building repairs and answering queries from the
				                            Australian public. He continued with this until mid 2001. He found the
				                            Western Australia Sunday Times Weekly papers went everywhere and his
				                            plans were copied in Kuala Lumpur, New Zealand, Germany, Britain and
				                            other countries. During 1957-1962 he had an office in John Martins from
				                            which he was able to operate an advice service for home builders. At
				                            this time he published seven books to assist home builders and employed
				                            architects and draughtsmen to assist him. The architects were young
				                            students who needed to fulfill a practical aspect of the architectural
				                            course. Four of them he felt were outstanding. They were Jessica
				                            Langhorn, Ross Bateup, Phil Bamforth and Phil Broehm. Others were given
				                            practical architectural work to assist them in their final year of
				                            studies. From 1963 to 1973 Max had an office in Myers, Rundle Street,
				                            having moved from John Martins. From here he ran the Myer Home Plan
				                            Service, giving advice to ordinary South Australians who couldn't
				                            necessarily afford the services of an architect. Max was then the
				                            Proprietor/Manager of this operation throughout Australia, but was based
				                            in Adelaide. In 1967 he opened his own building consultant's office in
				                            Gawler Place, Adelaide and employed other architects and draftsmen to
				                            continue the service to the public. From 1970 to 1990 Max had offices in
				                            Rundle Street and later at 196 North Terrace. He semi-retired in 1990
				                            but in 2001 still writes for the Sunday Mail and Advertiser and still
				                            does site inspections at the age of 83. Max has embraced the new media
				                            with offers of free advice to the public through his two sites on the
				                            web. </description>

         <description type="brief" xml:lang="en"> The engineering partnership of
				                            Hurren, Langman and James consisted of Frank Hurren ASASM (1899-1992),
				                            William Wilson Langman and Wesley Hughes James ME (Adel), FSASM, MIE
				                            Aust, (b1898). &amp;#8220;During 1928 Hurren established the first
				                            sustained consulting structural engineering practice in Adelaide to meet
				                            the small but growing need for more specialised reinforced concrete
				                            structural expertise. His practice survived the hard years of the
				                            Depression due to [Hurren&amp;#8217;s] drive and self-motivation. For
				                            over twenty years, the practice of Hurren, Langman and James was the
				                            pre-eminent consulting structural engineering firm in Adelaide, highly
				                            respected for its innovation and the quality of its work&amp;#8221;
				                            (Stacy 2005 p87). On 10 August 1956, on the retirement of Frank Hurren,
				                            the partnership of Hurren, Langman and James was dissolved. James and
				                            Langman continued as Langman and James from 1 July 1956. Frank Hurren
				                            studied at the S.A. School of Mines and Industries then worked in
				                            Sydney. On his return to Adelaide he worked with both E. Stone and M.S.
				                            Stanley, and later, in partnership with Langman and James he designed
				                            the structures of many Adelaide buildings, such as Shell House,
				                            Elizabeth House, the Bank of N.S.W. and the Savings Bank Building.
				                            William (Bill) Langman was Mayor of Burnside 1967-68 and was very active
				                            in the Adelaide Rotary Club. Wesley Hughes James studied at the
				                            University of Adelaide and became a Junior Assistant Engineer in the
				                            Engineer-in Chief's Department in 1922. He then went to England and
				                            America, returning to Adelaide in 1927 where he gained the Degree of
				                            Master of Engineering in 1931. James worked with W. Francis before
				                            joining with Hurren and Langman, where he designed such structures as
				                            the Pt. Augusta and Osborne Power Stations. He was Chairman of the
				                            Institution of Engineers (S.A. Division) in 1944 (Cumming and Moxam
				                            1986). </description>

         <description type="brief" xml:lang="en"> As well as being an architect and
				                            scholar, Gavin Walkley was a skilled educator and administrator, and he
				                            made a significant contribution to the advancement of design and
				                            planning education in the state. Born in 1911, Walkley lived at North
				                            Adelaide. He completed a Bachelor in Engineering (Architecture) at the
				                            University of Adelaide in 1934 having been articled since 1931 to Louis
				                            Laybourne Smith of Woods, Bagot, Laybourne Smith and Irwin.. He took his
				                            interest in the philosophy and history of art and architecture forward
				                            at the University of Cambridge where he completed a Bachelor of Arts in
				                            1938, and a Master of Letters in 1939, during which time he also worked
				                            for London architectural firms such as Sir Burnet, Tait &amp; Lorne.
				                            Walkley enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force in May 1940 and was
				                            sent to the Middle East and New Guinea. He completed a Master of Arts in
				                            the 1940s and during the 1950s he broadened his qualifications further
				                            through studies in town planning and landscape architecture. On
				                            returning to Adelaide and starting a family with his wife Barbara, he
				                            gained employment at the South Australian Housing Trust and later formed
				                            the private practice, Overall &amp; Walkley Architects &amp; Planners.
				                            During 1946 Walkley began to lecture at the School of Architecture in
				                            the School of Mines and Industries. In 1951 Walkley was appointed Head
				                            of the School of Architecture, a position he held until 1976. During
				                            that year Walkley joined Alan Welbourn, part-time, in private practice
				                            as Walkley &amp; Welbourn Architects &amp; Planners. Walkley was a
				                            long-time member of the South Australian Institute of Architects and its
				                            President. And after serving as a Royal Australian Institute of
				                            Architects councillor from 1960, he was elected President in 1965.
				                            Walkley provided forty years of service to the Architects&amp;#8217;
				                            Board of South Australia, including Chairmanship from 1973 until 1987.
				                            Walkley also held many positions with Royal Australian Planning
				                            Institute, the Australian Institute of Landscape Architects and the
				                            National Trust. The Walkley House, designed by Robin Boyd, along with
				                            his many educational, professional and civic contributions, was amongst
				                            the legacies of Gavin Walkley who died in 2005. </description>

         <description type="brief" xml:lang="en"> Jack Elhay
				                            (12/6/1912&amp;#8211;24/3/2006) used his surveying skills to enhance the
				                            development of Adelaide suburban areas in the 1960s. Elhay was born in
				                            Cairo, where he was educated and then worked as a quantity surveyor.
				                            Because of political unrest in Egypt, he and his family emigrated to
				                            Australia, settling in Adelaide in 1949. While working full time as a
				                            quantity surveyor, first for Fricker Brothers and then for Reid Murray
				                            Development, he completed a Bachelor of Arts degree at the University of
				                            Adelaide, graduating in 1956. Until his retirement Elhay remained with
				                            Reid Murray Development, which became Realty Development Corp, becoming
				                            general manager. He was involved in the building of the Queen Elizabeth
				                            Hospital, the development of the suburbs of Para Hills and Modbury and
				                            the redevelopment of the City Cross Arcade in Adelaide. Elhay could read
				                            in French, Spanish, Italian and English and enjoyed reading philosophy,
				                            psychology, music and classical literature. After he retired he gained a
				                            second Arts degree, majoring in Spanish, from Flinders University.

         <description type="brief" xml:lang="en"> Albert Gillissen, architect and
				                            academic, was born in The Netherlands on 7 September 1921. During World
				                            War Two he was a member of the resistance movement and between 1944 and
				                            1946 he worked as an interpreter for the Allied units in Holland,
				                            Germany and Austria. After that, in October 1946, he moved to Indonesia
				                            where he was employed as an immigration officer. In 1950 he joined the
				                            Dutch Merchant Navy and two years later, in 1952, he emigrated to New
				                            Zealand to work as a milking hand on a dairy farm and to take up other
				                            jobs. Deciding to become an architect, aged 31 he enrolled in
				                            architecture and town planning at the University of Auckland, graduating
				                            with honours in 1958. He received numerous grants and awards, including
				                            the University Prize for Excellence in Architecture (1956), an Honours
				                            Grant (1957), the NZ Universities Travelling Scholarship in Architecture
				                            (1959) and a Dutch government study grant. While studying, Gillissen
				                            worked in architects&amp;#8217; offices. In December 1959 he travelled
				                            to London where he was employed in the architectural design section of
				                            Ove Arup &amp; Partners, engineers for the Sydney Opera House, and in
				                            1960 he took up his Travelling Scholarship. After a further year of
				                            studies and research in European architecture he returned to Auckland
				                            where he worked in architectural offices and tutored at the University.
				                            During this time he was awarded a Postgraduate Diploma in Town Planning.
				                            He was appointed Senior Lecturer in Architecture at the University of
				                            Adelaide in 1963. Gillissen continued to practice as an architect after
				                            he came to Adelaide. His commissions included a feasibility study and
				                            master plan for accommodation on a 32-hectare site owned by the Lutheran
				                            Church at McLaren Vale as well as designs for a housing complex for the
				                            Kent Town Homes for the Aged. His study leave from the University of
				                            Adelaide in 1977 included a period as Visiting Professor at the
				                            Universiti Sains Malaysia. During 1981-82 he was Visiting Fellow at the
				                            National University of Singapore. He retired from academic life in 1986.
				                            He was a foundation member of the committee established to form the
				                            University of the Third Age (U3A) in South Australia and lectured in
				                            various groups from 1987 to 2006. From the 1980s he was involved, on a
				                            voluntary basis, with the revival of the home silk weaving industry in
				                            Isan, in north east Thailand and with the planning, development and
				                            design of several hectares of land with work studios and associated
				                            structures and housing. He designed his own eco-friendly timber house in
				                            Aldinga Beach where he lived from 1991 to 2007. Gillissen was made a
				                            Life Fellow of the RAIA SA Chapter in 2001. </description>

         <description type="brief" xml:lang="en"> Harold Thomas Griggs
				                            (14/3/1899&amp;#8211;1992) is one of South Australia&amp;#8217;s
				                            lesser-known but prolific architects. His work, which spanned
				                            approximately five decades, is significant because it represents the
				                            range of typical small- to medium-sized architectural commissions
				                            undertaken by sole practitioners in the twentieth century. Griggs
				                            received a well-rounded education in architecture, studying selected
				                            subjects at the South Australian School of Art, the South Australian
				                            School of Mines and Industries (School of Mines) and the University of
				                            Adelaide. During World War One he served in the 43rd Battalion,
				                            Australian Imperial Force as a Signaller. While stationed overseas he
				                            travelled as much as possible to further his knowledge of architecture
				                            and when the war finished he toured Great Britain, Europe and New York
				                            City. After returning to Australia in 1920 Griggs continued his
				                            architectural studies and in 1924 gained his Architectural
				                            Draftsman&amp;#8217;s Certificate from the School of Mines. His passion
				                            for learning led him to undertake further study from 1928 to 1929; he
				                            was awarded a South Australian Institute of Architects (SAIA) Annual
				                            Prize and in 1929 an &amp;#8216;evening studentship&amp;#8217;. His
				                            academic education was balanced by articled training from July 1926 to
				                            July 1929 at the well-known firm of Woods, Bagot, Jory and Laybourne
				                            Smith. This training and his Draftsman&amp;#8217;s Certificate allowed
				                            him to be admitted as an Associate to the SAIA in 1929 and a Fellow in
				                            1939. In 1941, with the introduction of the Architects Act, he
				                            registered as an architect. Griggs commenced private practice in
				                            Adelaide in August 1929 and, although he at times employed contractors,
				                            his practice remained small. He varied his working life by occasionally
				                            undertaking professional duties outside of his practice and in 1937 gave
				                            an educational broadcast for the Australian Broadcast
				                            Commission&amp;#8217;s (ABC) &amp;#8216;Homes and Habits
				                            Series&amp;#8217;. In 1956 he attended the Sixth Australian
				                            Architectural Convention in Adelaide that largely introduced modernism
				                            to the state. In 1968 he was on the planning committee for the Symposium
				                            &amp;#8216;Tomorrow&amp;#8217;s Housing&amp;#8217; held by the RAIA (SA
				                            Chapter) in Adelaide. In the first 10 years of his practice Griggs
				                            undertook many residential projects and experimented with a range of
				                            construction techniques, including a &amp;#8216;wood-framed stucco
				                            finish&amp;#8217; at Salisbury (1933) and numerous &amp;#8216;brick
				                            stucco&amp;#8217; houses in Tusmore (1935), Beaumont (1935) and Unley
				                            Park (1935). In the late 1930s he designed modern &amp;#8216;flat
				                            roof&amp;#8217; residences at Ashford (1937) and Somerton (1936). His
				                            numerous commercial commissions included modernising Adelaide Arcade for
				                            Netter &amp; Solomons (1935) and Gladys Sym Choon&amp;#8217;s premises
				                            in Rundle Street (1938). He balanced the design of warehouses with
				                            hospital additions in Mannum (1935) and the Soldiers&amp;#8217; Memorial
				                            Hospital at Pinnaroo (1935), not to mention clubhouses, hostels, flats
				                            and housing schemes. One of his most well-known hostel projects was
				                            additions and renovations to the Salvation Army&amp;#8217;s 1899
				                            People&amp;#8217;s Palace (1938) that provided low-cost, short-term
				                            accommodation. Griggs&amp;#8217;s contribution was not limited to his
				                            active service in both world wars and during World War Two he designed
				                            air raid shelters, for example at the Ramsgate Hotel at Henley Beach and
				                            modifying the Port Adelaide Town Hall to provide air-raid precautions.
				                            He also prepared munitions drawings for the Department of Interior,
				                            Salisbury and Cheltenham Works. He was one of the architects who worked
				                            on numerous Adelaide buildings that had sustained damage during an
				                            earthquake in the mid-1950s. In the latter decades he continued to work
				                            on a diverse range of commissions. </description>

				                            was founder and founding director of the Australian studies program at
				                            Flinders University. He taught architectural history in the Fine Arts
				                            program. In the 1970s he began collecting, accessioning and storing the
				                            archives of South Australian architects retired or retiring from private
				                            practice. In addition to using the material in his own research he
				                            curated several exhibitions. In 1990 he donated his entire collection to
				                            the School of the Built Environment at the South Australian Institute of
				                            Technology, a predecessor institution of the University of South
				                            Australia (UniSA). His collection became the Architecture Archives, and
				                            he was inaugural director. Johnson has been an Adjunct Professor of
				                            Architectural History at UniSA since 1995. He was made a Honorary Fellow
				                            of the Royal Australian Institute of Architects in 2005. </description>

         <description type="brief" xml:lang="en"> John Schenk studied architecture at
				                            the University of Adelaide, South Australia, graduating with honours in
				                            1964. Bonded to the Commonwealth Department of Works following four
				                            years as a cadet, he worked as an Architect Class 1, firstly at Woomera,
				                            where he was in charge of a day labour force of 400 personnel and then
				                            as a contract supervisor based in Adelaide. He continued his
				                            professional studies at the University of California at Berkeley and was
				                            awarded a Master of Architecture in 1967. His first teaching job was as
				                            a Teaching Assistant at an experimental &amp;#8220;Summer Residence
				                            College&amp;#8221; within the U.C. College of Letters and Science, an
				                            initiative organised as a reaction to large class sizes, in which the
				                            students obtained a grant, administered the program and selected the
				                            faculty. This was followed by professional experience in a number of
				                            prestigious firms in the Boston and Cambridge area. These American
				                            experiences greatly influenced his architectural and educational
				                            philosophies. From there he was appointed to the School of Architecture
				                            and Building at the SAIT. He has maintained his association with the
				                            School (now Art, Architecture and Design at the University of South
				                            Australia) for four successive decades, as Lecturer, Program Director
				                            and Acting Head. During this time he has continued to teach
				                            collaboratively with staff and students in the Planning and Construction
				                            Management and Economics disciplines. In the same vein, he spent periods
				                            of study leave at the South Australian Housing Trust, The State Heritage
				                            Branch and at Cambridge University. John has maintained a close
				                            involvement with the architecture profession serving as Chapter
				                            Councillor and a Vice President of the Australian Institute of
				                            Architects (SA Chapter), on various national and chapter committees, as
				                            a jury member for the awards program, and has been involved in
				                            architectural competitions as winner, jury member and competition
				                            advisor. He was the State Coordinator of the RAIA Significant 20th
				                            Century Architecture Program (1982 &amp;#8211; 85). He has served as the
				                            national assessor for the National Program of Assessment by the
				                            Architects Accreditation Council of Australia and sat on a number of
				                            National Visiting Panels for the accreditation of Schools of
				                            Architecture. He is a Life Fellow of the AIA and was appointed a
				                            Sessional Commissioner in the South Australian Environment Resources and
				                            Development Court. </description>

				                            (19/11/1892&amp;#8211;2/3/1952) figured prominently in the design and
				                            development of picture theatres and municipal buildings in Adelaide and
				                            regional South Australia during the 1920s and 1930s. Born in the Port
				                            Adelaide area, Smith completed less than eight years of schooling,
				                            leaving in 1906 to start a film distribution business with his five
				                            brothers. By 1915 he had trained as a master carpenter under Frickers
				                            and Son. Although he had no formal architectural training he practised
				                            as an architect and structural engineer between 1922 and 1932 in offices
				                            in King William Street, Adelaide. In the early 1930s he bought a
				                            property at Prospect and designed a fine Art Deco-style home that H.J.
				                            Emery built on the property&amp;#8217;s tennis court; he then worked
				                            from an office and studio above the garage. Although not fully accepted
				                            by Adelaide architects, Smith counted Caradoc Ashton, Norman Fisher,
				                            Jack Cheesman and Maurice Doley as friends. After the
				                            Architect&amp;#8217;s Registration Act came into force in 1939 he was
				                            registered from 1941 until his death in 1952, having fulfilled the
				                            requirement of working as an architect for the specified period. While
				                            the extent of Smith&amp;#8217;s connection with the York Theatre (opened
				                            November 1921, demolished 1961) in the city is unclear, for the next ten
				                            years he was involved in the construction of cinemas, including the
				                            Austral Picture Palace, Kilkenny (1922); Capri at Goodwood (1926; now on
				                            the State Heritage Register (SHR); Ozone Amusements at Alberton (1924);
				                            the Princess Theatre, Marryatville (1924, now known as the Chelsea and
				                            on the SHR for the 1941 Art Deco renovations designed by F.K. Milne);
				                            the Garden Theatre, Colonel Light Gardens (1926); and the Ozone Theatre,
				                            Enfield (1926), which was furnished and decorated on a lavish scale.
				                            Smith designed town halls for the regional towns of Clare (1925) and
				                            Peterborough (1926&amp;#8211;27). His municipal council buildings
				                            designed between 1935 and 1941 are all listed on the SHR. His Art
				                            Deco-style theatre/hall commissioned by the Hindmarsh Council (1936) is
				                            acknowledged as &amp;#8216;a remarkable example of civic architecture of
				                            the period.&amp;#8217; Other municipal offices and council chambers,
				                            again in Art Deco style, were designed for the Brighton Council
				                            (completed 1937) and Port Adelaide (1939), the latter being described as
				                            a fine example of Inter-War Functionalism. By 1941, Smith&amp;#8217;s
				                            calls for tenders had ceased, coinciding with his appointment as
				                            Inspector of Places of Public Entertainment. His years connected with
				                            film and the cinema ensured a strong commitment to public safety, and he
				                            criticised any practices that he regarded as unsafe. He was also on a
				                            committee during the war years for assessing buildings in case of
				                            bombing. In January 1946 Smith was admitted as an Associate of the South
				                            Australian Institute of Architects, although by then he was no longer
				                            working as an architect. Posthumously, he has received some recognition
				                            from the profession, with five of his buildings appearing in the Royal
				                            Australian Institute of Australia&amp;#8217;s listing of South Australia
				                            Significant Twentieth Century Architecture. Smith died at home in his
				                            60th year, having had a diverse and successful practice and leaving
				                            behind notable Art Deco buildings. </description>

				                            (11/12/1904&amp;#8211;14/3/1994) was born in Sydney and lived much of
				                            his childhood with his maternal grandmother and aunts, who very likely
				                            encouraged him to develop his drawing and to pursue a career in
				                            architecture. After two years at Newcastle High School, in about 1918
				                            Smith began work as a clerk, taking evening classes in art at the
				                            Hamilton Technical College from 1921 to 1923; he won the prize for top
				                            student in 1921. From 1925 to 1929 he was apprenticed to Wm. D. Jeater
				                            in the architectural firm of Thomas J. Pepper &amp; Jeater and in 1927
				                            began night studies for an architectural diploma at the Newcastle branch
				                            of Sydney Technical College, graduating in 1933. From 1930 to 1934 he
				                            was employed by several firms as a draftsman, and from 1935 to 1938 as
				                            supervising architect for P.J. Gannon, New Lambton, NSW. He then
				                            returned to Sydney to work as an architect for the Department of Works
				                            and Local Government. He joined the Commonwealth Department of Works in
				                            1941 and was sent to Adelaide; he married the artist Ruth Tuck in 1943.
				                            Smith returned to Newcastle in 1949 as a town planner for the
				                            Northumberland County Council, qualifying as a town planner in 1952. In
				                            1953 he returned to Adelaide as an architect for the Department of
				                            Works, where he remained until his retirement at the end of 1969. His
				                            early architectural works include the nurses&amp;#8217; home at the M.M.
				                            Hospital, Waratah and St Joseph&amp;#8217;s Church, Condobolin, both in
				                            NSW. When employed by the Department of Works and Local Government he
				                            was principally engaged on technical colleges, schools, hospitals and
				                            nurses&amp;#8217; homes. In South Australia he designed post offices and
				                            telephone exchanges in suburban and rural areas and was project
				                            architect for the terminal buildings at Adelaide Airport. Unfortunately,
				                            because of government bureaucracy, he was seldom given the opportunity
				                            to fully implement his original designs, thus there are relatively few
				                            buildings that truly reflect his ideas. In 1935 he gained a
				                            qualification with the Royal Sanitary Institute. He became an Associate
				                            of the Royal Australian Institute of Architects (RAIA) in 1938, Fellow
				                            in 1970. He qualified as an Associate of the Royal Association of
				                            British Architects in 1939 and, later, membership of the Royal
				                            Australian Planning Institute. The RAIA (SA Chapter) honoured the
				                            significance of his combination of architecture and art with an Award of
				                            Merit in 1984. In 1994 his contributions to Australia were belatedly
				                            recognised with an Order of Australia Medal. After his retirement from
				                            architecture he devoted all his time to his art and was president of the
				                            Royal South Australian Society of Arts from 1967 to 1970. From his first
				                            exhibition in 1947 until 1993 his works were shown in numerous solo,
				                            joint and group exhibitions and he won many prizes for his watercolours
				                            and drawings. His works are part of many permanent public collections in
				                            Australia. </description>

         <description type="brief" xml:lang="en"> John Richard Nowell Twopeny (born
				                            1/1/1929) worked as an architect in private practice throughout his
				                            career and his commissions spanned a broad range of projects. Born in
				                            Bowral, NSW, Twopeny was educated in South Australia at The Mount
				                            School, Mount Lofty and St Peter&amp;#8217;s College and graduated with
				                            a Bachelor of Engineering in 1952 from the University of Adelaide. He
				                            was in private practice as an architect between 1951 and 1959, being an
				                            associate to James S. Hall between 1954 and 1959; in 1959 he joined
				                            Kenneth Milne Boehm Bulbeck &amp; Partners as an associate, becoming
				                            partner in 1960. The firm became Kenneth Milne, Boehm, Twopeny &amp;
				                            Moss in 1961, Milne Boehm Twopeny &amp; Hodge in 1963, Boehm Twopeny
				                            &amp; Partners in 1973 and Boehm Twopeny Architects Pty Ltd in 1976. He
				                            took leave in 1954 to tour the United Kingdom and Europe, including
				                            eight months working in an architect&amp;#8217;s office in London. He
				                            undertook a world tour in 1976 and spent time in Indonesia in 1976.
				                            Twopeny&amp;#8217;s architectural commissions both in the Adelaide
				                            suburbs and rural areas of the state were varied and included industrial
				                            (BHP staff quarters amenities building, Whyalla), sporting (Flagstaff
				                            Hill Golf and Country Club clubhouse), commercial (offices for Gibbs
				                            Bright), educational (primary school library, Alice Springs), medical
				                            (wards and service wings, Estcourt House), residential (his first being
				                            for C.C. Deeley in 1950 and his last for C.F. Angas in 1977) and the
				                            hospitality industry (Traforti Restaurant, Barmera). Twopeny became an
				                            Associate of the Royal Australian Institute of Architects (RAIA) on
				                            graduating and a Fellow in 1970. Between 1967 and 1974 he served on the

				                            copy of will of Harold T Griggs. Included are references to bills for

         <description type="full"> &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Contains 10 series of material related to
				                            the career of Australian architect, Mervyn Ashmore Smith. Includes
				                            Student work (Newcastle Technical College), primarily 1927-34;
				                            Apprenticeship, 1925-29,work with J.P, Gannon, 1935-3; work with the
				                            Department of Works and Local Government, Sydney, 1938-41; work with the
				                            Department of Works, Adelaide, 1941-49; Town-planning work, primarily
				                            Newcastle and district, 1949-52; work with the Department of Works,
				                            Adelaide, 1953-69; Private work, 1927-c.1960; and certificates,
				                            curriculum vitae, interviews, and drafting tools and accessories. The
				                            more than 40 years of work includes many different categories of
				                            building, and several styles. Apart from the finished (printed) plans,
				                            there are also a large number of preliminary plans and sketches, not
				                            only from his private work, but also in particular from the Department
				                            of Works Adelaide, and from the town-planning. From these one can see
				                            Smith’s own extensive design-work particularly in three large projects –
				                            the War-Service Homes, Adelaide (1947-48), the town planning in and near
				                            Newcastle (1949-52), and the Adelaide Airport terminal (1956-57).
				                            Correspondence, specifications, and photographs are scattered unevenly
				                            through the overall collection. There are a few letters from Smith’s

				                            Jury and Robert Burden. The architectural practice of Jury Burden Pty
				                            Ltd was formed in the 1970s by Lynton D. Jury and Robert M. Burden who
				                            were both registered architects in South Australia. Robert Michael
				                            Burden gained a Diploma in Architecture from the South Australian
				                            Institute of Technology in 1966 and was made an Associate Member of the
				                            South Australian Chapter of the Royal Australian Institute of Architects
				                            in 1966. Lynton Douglas Jury graduated from the South Australian School
				                            of Mines in 1956 with an Associate Diploma in Architecture. He became an
				                            Associate member of the South Australian Chapter of the Royal Australian
				                            Institute of Architects in 1957. Between 1967 and 1970 Jury was in
				                            practise with Earnest Keal before he joined with Burden to form Jury
				                            Burden Pty Ltd which had offices at 312 South Terrace, Adelaide.

         <description type="brief" xml:lang="en"> Architects formed the South
				                            Australian Institute of Architects (SAIA) in 1886 as a professional body
				                            representing architects which also helped to redefine architecture as a
				                            profession. The SAIA worked on behalf of architects with regard to
				                            architectural education, codes of ethics, regulations, conditions of
				                            contract and architectural competition regulations. In 1904 Walter Bagot
				                            designed the seal of the SAIA. A federation of all state institutes of
				                            architects in Australia was established and the Royal Australian
				                            Institute of Architects was incorporated in 1930. However the SAIA
				                            continued to call itself by its original name rather than become a
				                            chapter of the RAIA. In 1940 the Architects Board of South Australia was
				                            established in order to register architects under the newly passed
				                            Architects Act 1939. In 1962 the SAIA voted to surrender its identity
				                            and became the RAIA (SA Chapter). Also in the 1960s the RAIA (SA
				                            Chapter) operated a Small Homes Service which provided architect
				                            designed house plans for a nominal fee to the general public. The
				                            chapter was also a strong advocate for the Planning and Development Act
				                            of 1967. Since the federation of the institutes in 1930, many South
				                            Australians have served as national President of the RAIA: Philip
				                            Claridge, Guy St John Makin, Louis Laybourne Smith, Jack Cheesman,
				                            Wilfred Haslam, James Irwin, Jack McConnell, Gavin Walkley, Robert Hall,
				                            Robert Cheesman, and David Parken. In August 2008, the Royal Australian
				                            Institute of Architects changed its name to the Australian Institute of
				                            Architects. </description>

				                            when it moved to the Brookman Building, now part of the University of
				                            South Australia. The first School of Architecture was begun in 1906 by
				                            Louis Laybourne Smith and Walter Hervey Bagot. The School of
				                            Architecture was first named after Louis Laybourne Smith an early
				                            prominent architect and the School’s first full time lecturer. After the
				                            Second World War the School experienced a rapid expansion with a flood
				                            of applicants for architectural training. Gavin Walkley, who succeeded
				                            Laybourne Smith as Head of School, proceeded to expand the School's
				                            programs to embrace all major skills relevant to the built environment.
				                            Town Planning (the first course of its kind in Australia), Building
				                            Technology, Interior Design and Landscape Architecture were offered. In
				                            1960 the School of Mines was renamed the South Australian Institute of
				                            Technology and the range of course offered in building and allied skills
				                            increased. By 1963 the School had developed its activities in the
				                            building discipline as distinct from architecture to such an extent that
				                            the new name of the School of Architecture and Building was adopted. In
				                            1991, the South Australian Institute of Technology and the South
				                            Australian College of Advanced Education merged to form the University
				                            of South Australia. At the beginning of 1997, the School moved into the
				                            newly completed City West campus. Today, the School has over 20
				                            full-time academic staff and 650 undergraduate students in the three
				                            disciplines of Architecture, Interior Architecture and Industrial
				                            Design.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; </description>

				                            Woods Bagot (1), W. H. Bagot (2), Woods Bagot Jory (3), Woods Bagot Jory
				                            and Laybourne Smith (4), and Woods Bagot Laybourne Smith and Irwin (5).
				                            Comprised of: Edward John Woods (1839-1916), Walter Hervey Bagot
				                            (1880-1963), Harold Herbert Jory (1888-1966), Louis Edouard Laybourne
				                            Smith (1880-1965), and Sir James Campbell Irwin (1906-1990). Edward John
				                            Woods was born in London in 1839. Woods decided to emigrate to South
				                            Australia and arrived in Port Adelaide in 1860. His South Australian
				                            architectural career began as a draughtsman for Edmund Wright soon
				                            becoming a partner in the practice of Wright and Woods. This partnership
				                            lasted about four years. In 1869 the partnership was dissolved and Woods
				                            worked as a sole practitioner. Woods then formed a partnership with
				                            William McMinn. In about 1873 Woods joined the public service as an
				                            architect to the Council of Education, simultaneously maintaining his
				                            private practice. He was subsequently appointed Architect-in-Chief of
				                            South Australia in 1877. He left the government in 1884 and in 1905
				                            began a partnership with Walter Bagot, who had been a former pupil with
				                            the practice being named Woods &amp; Bagot. Walter Hervey Bagot was born
				                            on 17 March 1880 at North Adelaide. He was articled to Adelaide
				                            architect Edward John Woods in 1899 for his architectural training. In
				                            1902 he left for the United Kingdom where he had studied architecture at
				                            the Kings College, University of London. In 1906 Bagot had helped Louis
				                            Laybourne Smith to found the School of Architecture at the South
				                            Australian School of Mines and Industries (now University of South
				                            Australia) and subsequently lectured there in architectural history
				                            until 1911. Both men have been remembered as having ‘towered above
				                            their contemporaries’ (Irwin 1980, p.21). The partnership between
				                            Woods and Bagot lasted from 1905 until 1913. Edward Woods died on 5
				                            January 1916, following a decline in his health. Two years later in
				                            1915, Herbert Harold Jory became a partner and the practice was known as
				                            Woods, Bagot &amp; Jory until 1917 when Louis Laybourne Smith was
				                            offered a partnership and accepted. The partnership of Woods, Bagot,
				                            Jory &amp; Laybourne Smith continued until 1930 when Jory left to
				                            practise on his own. In 1932 James Campbell Irwin was admitted as a
				                            partner and the practice was then reconstituted as Woods, Bagot,
				                            Laybourne Smith &amp; Irwin. Bagot stoped being an active partner
				                            ‘some five or six years before he officially retired’ (Irwin
				                            1980, p.34). Bagot died on 27 July 1963 at North Adelaide aged 83. The
				                            practice continues today as one of Australia’s largest
				                            architectural firms and is called Woods Bagot continuing the names of
				                            its two founding partners. [Note: The State Library of South Australia
				                            holds records of Woods Bagot Architects 1882-1975 in BRG 18, including
				                            letter books, account books, partnership records, photographs,
				                            brochures, plans and drawings, and a list of works executed.] </description>

         <description type="full"> &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Contains material related to work on
				                            commercial premises by structural engineering firm, Hurren, Langman and
				                            James Engineers. Includes work on Includes plans, calculations,
				                            estimates, and drawings for the construction of various building
				                            projects for shops, banks, insurance companies, societies and trusts,
				                            principally in South Australia. Includes 99 SubSeries. These records are
				                            organised firstly under the function carried out in the building, then
				                            under the name of the firm occupying the premises where alterations took
				                            place, at the time. As firms changed location or a different firm
				                            occupied the same building, it was given a different job number. This is
				                            reflected in the ordering of the Items (the second lot of numbers)
				                            within the Series (numbers beginning with S). Trusts, Societies,
				                            Insurance Companies, banks and Benevolent Funds had alterations to
				                            buildings with no indication as to the function of their organisation or
				                            the building. It was concluded that most would run a shop front for
				                            customers or clients. Where there is only an architect named in the
				                            personnel list, the estimations and Hurren Langman &amp; James carried
				                            out calculations for all the jobs. Their name has not been added for
				                            simplicity and readability. Often the jobs have descriptions such as
				                            store, with no further description given as to whether the job is in a
				                            retail shop or a storage place. Some jobs are listed under the names of
				                            specific buildings ie Rust &amp; Watson Building in Berri or Watson
				                            House in Adelaide. As firms grew, they needed larger premises so moved
				                            to another location. In these circumstances the same name of the firm is
				                            kept but a different number at the end of the location string indicates
				                            the change of location. Different branches of the same bank are also
				                            indicated in this manner. The East End Market precinct was originally a
				                            collection of very small shops, stalls and offices located in the East
				                            Terrace area. The records relating to buildings in this area are all
				                            listed under East End Market. Their size gave no indication of the
				                            amount of trade that took place as it was a market for wholesale buyers
				                            of fresh produce from growers whose produce was then dispersed all over
				                            Adelaide and closer country areas to other shops or green grocers.
				                            Either the name of the firm or the shop number under the overall
				                            location of East End Market indicates alterations to individual
				                            buildings.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; </description>

         <description type="full"> &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Architects of South Australia
				                            database is the public face of the South Australian Architects and their
				                            Works project which was undertaken by a team of academic researchers
				                            from the Architecture Museum, Louis Laybourne Smith School of
				                            Architecture and Design, University of South Australia, with funding
				                            from the Department for Environment and Heritage. A project Reference
				                            Group guided the selection of architects for research. The research team
				                            has organised the development of the online database which is being
				                            updated and added to regularly. It is a database of material about the
				                            professional lives and contributions of a selection of the state's
				                            architects from 1836 to the present day. In addition to providing
				                            scholarly biographical information, the database also identifies the
				                            architects' principal South Australian built works. Note, however, that
				                            the listings are not comprehensive. The Research Team comprised Dr
				                            Christine Garnaut, Dr Julie Collins, Dr Susan Lustri, Ms Alison
				                            McDougall, and Mrs Christine Sullivan. Although the built environment is
				                            shaped by the work of many professions, the scope of this project was
				                            limited to architects. An architect was defined as an individual who, in
				                            colonial times, was referred to by that title or, later, one who had
				                            either an articled training, an academic education in architecture, or
				                            had satisfied the requirements of registration. The list of works
				                            provided for each architect is not comprehensive but rather is a
				                            selection of principal South Australian built works identified from the
				                            sources consulted. The South Australian Architects and their Works
				                            collection comprises papers and bibliographies collected by the project
				                            team during his research, including some profiles of architects and
				                            their works; information and copies of documents relating to papers,
				                            articles, and books on South Australian Architects.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; </description>

         <description type="brief"> &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Dean Walter Berry (1904-1986)
				                            was a distinguished twentieth century Adelaide architect who played a
				                            leading role in the restoration of significant heritage buildings whilst
				                            also designing buildings in the modern style. Educated at St Peter’s
				                            College, Berry was then articled to architect Eric McMichael. Whilst an
				                            articled pupil he studied architecture at the South Australian School of
				                            Mines and Industries before travelling overseas. On his return to
				                            Adelaide in 1928, Berry established his own architectural practice.
				                            Stephen Gilbert joined the office and in 1938 became a partner with the
				                            practice renamed Berry &amp; Gilbert. In 1959, with the addition
				                            of Brian Polomka as a partner in the practice, the firm was renamed
				                            Berry, Gilbert and Polomka Architects. And after Brian Riches joined the
				                            office the practice was re-constituted as Berry, Polomka, Riches
				                            &amp; Gilbert Pty Ltd in 1981. Berry started his architectural
				                            career designing mainly residences, alterations and additions. His works
				                            include St Barnabas, Croydon (1929), St Hugh’s, Angaston (1930), Council
				                            Chambers and offices at Mitcham in 1934 in the modern style, and the now
				                            demolished Centennial Hall at Wayville (1935). He was a member of the
				                            Architects Board of SA between 1940 and 1973 serving as Chairman from
				                            1946 to 1973. He was an active member of the South Australian Institute
				                            of Architects (SAIA), serving as President from 1939 to 1941. The
				                            National Trust was one of Berry’s main interests. Berry’s concern for
				                            heritage can be seen reflected in his contributions to several
				                            publications. Dean Berry was made a Commander of the Most Excellent
				                            Order of the British Empire (CBE) for his ‘contribution to the
				                            profession of architecture’.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; </description>

         <description type="brief" xml:lang="en"> Harold Boas
				                            (27/9/1883&amp;#8211;17/9/1980), an architect and town planner, was also
				                            prominent in civic and political affairs and within the Jewish
				                            congregation of Western Australia. Boas was born in Adelaide and
				                            attended state primary school and then Whinham College, completing his
				                            final three years at Prince Alfred College. An interest in drawing
				                            prompted him to become an architect. He was indentured to the Adelaide
				                            architect Edward Davies between 1899 and 1904, at the same time
				                            completing subjects at the South Australian School of Mines and
				                            Industry. He spent a year as a draftsman in Davies&amp;#8217; office
				                            before moving to Western Australia in 1905 where he went into private
				                            practice as an architect. Around 1907 he took over the practice of
				                            Austin Bastow in Perth and from 1912 to 1916 formed the partnership of
				                            Summerhayes and Boas with Edwin Summerhayes. In 1920 he continued the
				                            practice of the late Charles Oldham; in 1923 the firm became Oldham,
				                            Boas &amp; Ednie-Brown when Colin Ednie-Brown joined. Commissions were
				                            varied and the practice designed churches and synagogues, social,
				                            educational and charitable buildings, and all classes of industrial,
				                            commercial, banking and insurance buildings. Boas became interested in
				                            town planning when, in 1914, as a Perth City Councillor, he helped to
				                            organise a series of lectures by Charles Reade, a representative of the
				                            Garden Cities and Town Planning Association of Great Britain. Boas
				                            extended his knowledge of garden cities when on overseas service during
				                            the First World War and on a later trip to the United Kingdom, Europe
				                            and North America in 1929. In 1928 he was appointed Chairman of the
				                            Metropolitan Town Planning Commission that reported to the State
				                            government on planning matters. He then helped to create a Town Planning
				                            Committee within the Perth City Council and was Chairman of this
				                            Committee until 1942. Following the Second World War he prepared town
				                            planning schemes for several local government authorities, including the
				                            City of Fremantle. In 1970 he was appointed to a government committee to
				                            report on the development of the Perth railway and on the treatment of
				                            railway land. He was prominent in both architecture and town planning
				                            institutes. He transferred his associateship of the South Australian
				                            Institute of Architects to the Western Australian Institute of
				                            Architects when he moved west. He was a member of the West Australian
				                            Chapter Council for some years. He was made a Life Fellow of the Royal
				                            Australian Institute of Architects in 1943 and served on its Council
				                            including taking on a term as Vice-President. He was the first Secretary
				                            of the Town Planning Association of Western Australia (1914), foundation
				                            President of the first Planning Institute of Western Australia (1914),
				                            was elected a member of the Town Planning Institute of Great Britain and
				                            of the American Town Planning Institute (1929) and was the Australian
				                            representative at the International Town Planning and Housing Congress
				                            held in Rome in 1929. He was made a Life Fellow of the Royal Planning
				                            Institute of Australia, was elected a member of the Institute of Urban
				                            Studies and was granted the inaugural Silver Medal of the Australian
				                            Planning Institute of Western Australia when he retired from practice in
				                            1974. Active in conservative politics for many years, Boas
				                            unsuccessfully stood for the Legislative Council in 1932. He was on the

				                            York (CCNY) is a U.S. philanthropic foundation established with the vast
				                            wealth of Scottish steel magnate and &amp;#8216;father of American
				                            philanthropy&amp;#8217;, Andrew Carnegie in 1911. Under the direction of
				                            Frederick P. Keppel (1923-1941), the corporation expanded their
				                            activities, largely centred on library development and donation of
				                            church organs, to include adult education and the arts. Between 1927 and
				                            1941, the CCNY developed the &amp;#8216;Commonwealth Program&amp;#8217;

				                            British Empire. This included Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and parts
				                            of Africa and Asia. The history of Carnegie philanthropy throughout the
				                            British Empire continues to attract criticism as a form of cultural
				                            diplomacy or cultural imperialism, where the desire to secure
				                            international relations of strategic importance was the driving force
				                            behind grants and assistance in education. </description>

         <description type="brief" xml:lang="en"> Philip George Brian Claridge was
				                            the son of prominent Adelaide architect Philip Rupert Claridge
				                            (1884&amp;#8211;1968). He was educated at Prince Alfred College and
				                            graduated with a Bachelor of Engineering from the University of Adelaide
				                            in 1945. He was then articled to his father's firm, Claridge, Hassell
				                            and McConnell. When this partnership was dissolved in 1949 Brian joined
				                            with his father in Claridge &amp; Gunn for a decade then moved to the
				                            Adelaide office of Melbourne firm Stephenson &amp; Turner, working there
				                            until he ceased practising architecture in 1969. In the 1950s Claridge
				                            was a leading advocate of the modern movement, lobbying for change and
				                            also publishing widely on architecture and art. He joined with other
				                            young architects &amp;#8211; John Morphett, Keith Neighbour, Dick
				                            Roberts, John Chappel, Laurie Brownell, Alan Godfrey and Newell Platten
				                            &amp;#8211; to form the Contemporary Architects Group. He was on the
				                            organising committee of an exhibition staged in 1956 by the Royal
				                            Australian Institute of Architects (RAIA) in conjunction with the Sixth
				                            Australian Architectural Convention. Held in Botanic Park in the
				                            Adelaide Parklands the Exhibition was designed to showcase architecture
				                            by means of models and actual buildings and hence stimulate interest in
				                            the latest developments in architecture. Claridge's residential designs
				                            included a house for his father at Toorak Gardens (1951) and for himself
				                            at Stonyfell (1952). His Sedunary House at Crafers (1957), which
				                            featured in Best Australian Houses (1961) and was included in Houses
				                            around Adelaide (1964), is regarded as one of the best Australian homes
				                            designed in the 1950s. Educational commissions included kindergartens at
				                            Rose Park (1958) and Newlands Park (1959), Loreto Convent Junior School
				                            (1961&amp;#8211;62) and Cabra Senior School (1963&amp;#8211;65). In the
				                            early 1960s he designed banks for the ES&amp;A in Adelaide and Tanunda
				                            and oversaw renovations to several Catholic churches and buildings in
				                            central Adelaide. Claridge's architectural career was relatively brief
				                            for he was involved in practice for only two decades. In 1969 he was
				                            appointed Lecturer in Architecture at the University of Adelaide. Until
				                            his premature death in 1979, when he was Senior Lecturer in
				                            Architecture, he continued to write and publish. </description>

         <description type="brief" xml:lang="en"> Philip Rupert Claridge (1884-1968)
				                            was a founder of what has become one of Australia&amp;#8217;s largest
				                            architectural practices, Hassell. Claridge was born in Crystal Brook in
				                            rural South Australia and was educated locally and in Adelaide. After
				                            leaving school he attended the SA School of Mines and Industries and was
				                            articled to Edward Davies in 1903 for his architectural training. In
				                            1911 Claridge married Evelyn Degenhardt, they had a daughter, Evelyn and
				                            a son, P.G. Brian Claridge who also became an architect. In 1930
				                            Claridge opened his own practice with offices in Renmark and Adelaide
				                            working with various associates. He took on two associates, Russell
				                            Ellis and Colin Hassell to become Philip R. Claridge and Associates. In
				                            1937 Jack McConnell moved to South Australia to begin work with the
				                            practice. In 1939 the practice became Philip R. Claridge, Hassell and
				                            McConnell. The practice continues as Hassell with offices both
				                            nationally and internationally. While working with Hubert H. Cowell he
				                            designed the Memorial Block at Prince Alfred College and the later
				                            Preparatory School building (1936). Claridge designed many suburban
				                            residences, including one for V. Claring-Bould, Heywood Avenue, Unley
				                            Park, and his own homes in both in Toorak Gardens. Claridge designed the
				                            Westbourne Park Methodist Church and Girton Girl&amp;#8217;s School,
				                            Kensington Park (now part of Pembroke School). In 1936 the practice
				                            designed the Port Lincoln Soldiers Memorial Hall which features Art Deco
				                            inspired interiors. Another built work by Claridge, Bruer and Fisher is
				                            Sands and MacDougall&amp;#8217;s building on King William Street,
				                            Adelaide (1933). The Bank of NSW, Adelaide, (1937-38) designed by a
				                            young Jack McConnell for the practice is perhaps the
				                            practice&amp;#8217;s first truly modern building. Philip Claridge was an
				                            active member of the South Australian Institute of Architects (SAIA)
				                            serving as President. He was also President of the Royal Australian
				                            Institute of Architects from 1931 to 1932. Philip Claridge was very
				                            active in his local community serving as a member of Burnside City
				                            Council for 25 years as well as being twice elected Mayor. </description>

         <description type="brief" xml:lang="en"> Robert Harold Dickson (born
				                            8/4/1926) was educated at Christ Church School, Adelaide. Following
				                            World War Two he studied architecture at the South Australian School of
				                            Mines and Industries, graduating in 1953. While still a student he built
				                            his own house at Wandilla Drive, Rostrevor, which was featured in the
				                            Royal Institute of British Architects Exhibition of Australian
				                            Architecture, 1956. During and immediately following his studies
				                            (1948&amp;#8211;55) he was articled to Claridge, Hassell and McConnell
				                            where he was deeply influenced by Modernist architect Jack McConnell. In
				                            1955 he worked for Mangiarotti and Morasutti architects in Milan, Italy,
				                            an important influence on his future work and his love of things
				                            Italian. He then travelled to London and worked for Fry, Drew, Drake and
				                            Lasdun architects. On returning to Adelaide Dickson began his own
				                            practice and in 1958 joined with Newell Platten; Dickson and Platten
				                            continued until Platten joined the SA Housing Trust in 1973. The
				                            practice was renamed Robert Dickson and Associates, in 1990 becoming
				                            Robert Dickson Architects. In 1956 Robert Dickson and Brian Claridge
				                            instigated an exhibition in conjunction with the Sixth Australian
				                            Architectural Convention that was staged by the Royal Australian
				                            Institute of Architects (RAIA) in Adelaide&amp;#8217;s Botanic Park. It
				                            was designed to show architecture by means of models and actual
				                            buildings and hence stimulate interest in the latest developments in
				                            architecture. The Arkaba restaurant at Glen Osmond Road, Fullarton
				                            (1963) and subsequent hotel was Dickson and Platten&amp;#8217;s first
				                            large-scale commercial project. It won the RAIA SA Chapter Award of
				                            Merit and is known for its &amp;#8216;intimate planning and straight
				                            forward use of natural materials&amp;#8217;. The practice designed golf
				                            clubs at Mt Lofty (1968), Blackwood (1970) and Regency Park (1978), the
				                            Youth Camp for the National Fitness Council at Mylor (1969), and the
				                            Whyalla Recreation Centre. Educational building complexes were a
				                            significant component of the firm&amp;#8217;s work and Kathleen Lumley
				                            College, a residential college for university students, won the 1969
				                            RAIA (SA Chapter) Award of Merit. One of the most significant buildings,
				                            however, is the Adelaide University Union complex, a five-level red
				                            brick and concrete building with exposed brickwork and timber detailing
				                            that was built in stages between 1967 and 1975. It received an Award of
				                            Merit from the RAIA in 1974 and a Civic Trust Award in 1975. Office
				                            buildings by the practice include its own offices at Mackinnon Parade,
				                            North Adelaide (1966), the Associated Securities Offices, Hindmarsh
				                            Square, Adelaide, which received an RAIA (SA Chapter) 1972 citation, and
				                            the Salisbury Civic Centre, which received the RAIA (SA Chapter) 1976
				                            Award of Merit. The Hope Valley Water Filtration Plant (1976) received
				                            the RAIA (SA Chapter) 1980 Award of Merit. On graduation Dickson became
				                            an Associate of the RAIA (SA Chapter) and was made a Fellow in 1970;
				                            from 1978 to 1980 he was President and in 1981 was made a Life Fellow;
				                            in 1996 he became a Privileged Life Fellow. After receiving numerous
				                            awards for his architectural works, the RAIA (SA Chapter) awarded him
				                            the President&amp;#8217;s Medal in 2000. In 1957 he wrote feature
				                            articles on architecture for the Advertiser and later a regular column
				                            in the News and also tutored at the University of Adelaide&amp;#8217;s
				                            Faculty of Architecture and Planning; he then became a Research Scholar
				                            in the Faculty. He was a Forestry Board Member and Adviser for the Woods
				                            and Forests Department from 1978 to 1984. His concern with the built
				                            environment was reflected through his role as President of the Civic
				                            Trust of South Australia from 1978 to 1980. Dickson is one of the most
				                            significant practitioners of modern architecture in Adelaide. His work
				                            displays a sensitive relationship to site, intuitive use of materials
				                            and care about design and craftsmanship. </description>

         <description type="brief" xml:lang="en"> Russell Stuart Ellis was one of the
				                            early architects in South Australia to design in the Modern style. Born
				                            at Glanville, South Australia on 20 August 1912 Ellis studied
				                            architecture at the South Australian School of Mines and Industries and
				                            graduated in 1934. He was influenced by the American Beaux Arts system
				                            of architectural education and this is evident in Ellis finely drafted
				                            and water coloured design projects. While he was a student he worked for
				                            architects Lionel G. Bruer, Norman Fisher and Philip Claridge. Once
				                            Ellis graduated he continued to work with Philip Claridge in the
				                            practice of P. R. Claridge and Associates. This practice became
				                            Claridge, Hassell and McConnell in 1939. Ellis began designing in the
				                            International style soon after he began practicing in the late 1930s. He
				                            designed his own modern residence at Brookside Avenue, Springfield which
				                            was built c.1942. From 1941 until the end of the war Ellis worked for
				                            the Department of the Interior, moving to Darwin in 1943 returning in
				                            April 1944. In 1945 Ellis took a job working with the Allied Works
				                            Council, Department of Public Works, Adelaide during which time he
				                            worked on the CSIRO Biochemistry laboratory building at the University
				                            of Adelaide, Adelaide campus. In the period following the war, from 1945
				                            to 1946, Ellis wrote a series of articles for South Australian Homes and
				                            Gardens. It was between 1947 and 1953 that he privately designed a
				                            residence for Charles Wright, in Meadowvale Road, Springfield in the
				                            Modern style. In 1947 when he joined the practice of F.K. Milne, Dawkins
				                            and Boehm as a junior partner, he contributed to the design of
				                            factories, showrooms and theatres throughout South Australia. Following
				                            his move into sole practice in 1958 Ellis completed many religious
				                            buildings. He moved to Whyalla on a contract with Broken Hill
				                            Proprietary and worked there between 1966 and 1970. He retired in 1971
				                            and passed away on 2 February 1988. </description>

				                            Adelaide architects, engineers and students who formed an architectural
				                            club in 1929, when the Depression meant that there was not enough work
				                            to keep them fully employed. The club set design exercises which were to
				                            be completed within a set time frame, usually 1 to 2 hours. The drawings
				                            produced range from pencil only renderings to pen and wash and elaborate
				                            watercolours. The subject matter for the design problems range from
				                            magazine covers to libraries, and memorial tablets to fountains.
				                            Following the Depression many of these architects and engineers went on
				                            to become well known and respected practitioners. Members of the Forum
				                            Club included: Clifford C. Jenner, Stanley Pointer, Reginald J.

         <description type="brief" xml:lang="en"> The contribution of Sir James
				                            Campbell Irwin (23/6/1906&amp;#8211;22/6/1990) to South Australia was
				                            not just architectural but through his services to local government and
				                            the wider community. Irwin was educated at Queen&amp;#8217;s School and
				                            St Peter&amp;#8217;s College. Influenced by his cousin Leighton Irwin,
				                            founder of the Architectural Atelier at the University of Melbourne, he
				                            studied architecture at the South Australian School of Mines and
				                            Industries, graduating in 1926 with an Architectural
				                            Draftsman&amp;#8217;s Certificate. In 1924 he was articled to George K.
				                            Soward of English and Soward, architects principally engaged on
				                            substantial homes for the wealthy. Following the completion of his
				                            articles, in 1928 Irwin joined Woods, Bagot, Jory and Laybourne Smith.
				                            In 1930, at the age of 24, he became a partner, with the practice
				                            renamed Woods, Bagot, Laybourne Smith and Irwin; he remained a senior
				                            partner from 1965 until his retirement in 1974. James Irwin was the
				                            designer of Carrick Hill, a large English manor-style house set on a 43
				                            hectare site at Springfield (1937&amp;#8211;9). The two-storey house,
				                            constructed of Basket Range sandstone, has an asymmetric design with
				                            Elizabethan-style chimney stacks and gabled and hipped roof forms. Much
				                            of the internal wood finishings came from sixteenth-century Beau Desert
				                            Castle, Staffordshire. From 1947 to 1974 Irwin continued the
				                            firm&amp;#8217;s connection with the Anglican Church when he replaced
				                            Bagot as architect for St Peter&amp;#8217;s Cathedral, North Adelaide.
				                            Other religious, educational and medical buildings designed by
				                            Irwin&amp;#8217;s firm included Scotch College Chapel, Seymour College,
				                            St Mark&amp;#8217;s College, Calvary Hospital and the Julia Farr Centre.
				                            Central Business District office buildings included the Da Costa

				                            buildings in North Terrace and the Building Centre in South Terrace.
				                            During 1957 the Advertiser newspaper and other Adelaide businesses
				                            sponsored Irwin to visit the USA to inspect newspaper office buildings
				                            and children&amp;#8217;s hospitals to ascertain the latest developments
				                            in the field for Woods, Bagot, Laybourne Smith and Irwin, which had
				                            gained the commissions for the rebuilding of the Advertiser newspaper
				                            offices and the Adelaide Children&amp;#8217;s Hospital. The Advertiser
				                            Building on King William Street utilised a new construction method for
				                            pouring concrete floors on lost formwork in multi-storey buildings.
				                            Irwin became an Associate member of the South Australian Institute of
				                            Architects in 1930, a Fellow in 1941 and President from 1956 to 1958. He
				                            was President of the Royal Australian Institute of Architects (RAIA)

				                            RAIA (SA Chapter) named its President&amp;#8217;s Medal in his honour.
				                            He was also a Fellow of the Royal Australian Planning Institute and the
				                            Royal Society of Arts, London. From 1938 to 1940 and from 1947 to 1953

         <description type="brief" xml:lang="en"> Rolf Jensen (1912&amp;#8211;1994)
				                            had 40 years of widely varied experience in architecture and town
				                            planning, working in private practice and for governments in Britain,
				                            South East Asia and Australia, and in universities. Visits to cathedrals
				                            with his photographer father combined with the encouragement of an
				                            enlightened headmaster convinced Jensen to study architecture. He gained
				                            a Bachelor of Architecture (Hons) from Liverpool University in 1933 and
				                            degrees in Town Planning from the London School of Planning and in
				                            Engineering from the University of Adelaide (1957). Between 1934 and
				                            1938 he was in private practice in London and in the English provinces
				                            as well as collaborating with architects who advocated the modern
				                            movement. He then worked for the Admiralty in London and on the naval
				                            base in Singapore. Following World War Two, when he served with the
				                            Royal Engineers in the India&amp;#8211;Burma theatre, he was appointed
				                            Director of Housing and Borough Architect for North Westminster in
				                            London. In 1956 Jensen was recruited to the University of Adelaide as
				                            Foundation Professor of the School of Architecture and Planning. He
				                            oversaw the introduction of a full-time five-year course devoted solely
				                            to architecture, introduced in 1958; he was then appointed Dean of the
				                            new Faculty of Architecture and Town Planning. While at the university
				                            he was involved with a number of studies related to city planning and
				                            renewal, housing, and traffic. In April 1959 he published a series of
				                            articles in the evening paper, the News, on the state of
				                            Adelaide&amp;#8217;s main highways and how they could be modernised. He
				                            roundly criticised the Metropolitan Adelaide Transportation Study (MATS)
				                            released in 1968 because its proposed expressways threatened to tear
				                            apart some of Adelaide&amp;#8217;s suburbs. He also opposed plans to
				                            build the satellite city of Monarto, calling it &amp;#8216;a fundamental
				                            blunder&amp;#8217; and argued against a proposed petro-chemical plant at
				                            Redcliffs. These public comments had made him a controversial figure by
				                            the time he retired in January 1976. During his career Jensen travelled
				                            widely and studied city planning at first hand in many cities and was a
				                            planning consultant to governments and large development corporations.
				                            As well, he lectured and wrote extensively on aspects of architecture
				                            and planning. He had a particular interest in planning for cities and in
				                            addition to numerous papers, he published High Density Living (1966),
				                            Cities of Vision (1974) and (with his wife Elfrida) Colonial
				                            Architecture in South Australia (1980). The University of Adelaide

         <description type="brief" xml:lang="en"> Ralph Knowles was born 7 July 1917.
				                            After attending Adelaide High School as a boy Ralph began working at
				                            L.G. Abbott&amp;#8217;s as a Design Draftsman in the glass and
				                            shopfitting field. During the war he worked at General Motors
				                            Holden&amp;#8217;s on aircraft project engineering and motor body
				                            styling. At the end of the war he spent 3 years freelancing as a
				                            shopfitting and commercial designer. Ralph then obtained employment with
				                            Lawson, Cheesman and Doley. He dedicated over 20 years of his life to
				                            architectural design. In that time he was made an Associate of the
				                            Company. During his 22 years with Cheesman, Doley, Neighbour and Raffen
				                            Ralph was responsible for planning, documentation and administration
				                            work ranging over homes for the aged, hotels, motels, cinemas,

				                            to failing eyesight. His many interests included making furniture,
				                            bicycling, and playing music. Ralph Knowles died on 11 August 2004.

         <description type="brief"> &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Donald Langmead (29/8/1939–), architect,
				                            academic and architectural historian, was born and grew up in Adelaide.
				                            The son of a truck driver, he attended Adelaide Technical High School
				                            and then studied architecture at the South Australian Institute of
				                            Technology (SAIT; the University of South Australia (UniSA) from 1958,
				                            graduating with an Associateship Diploma of Architecture in 1966 and a
				                            Graduate Diploma in Town Planning in 1972. He then travelled to England
				                            to study at the University of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, graduating with a
				                            Master of Science (Architecture) in 1974. He completed his doctoral
				                            dissertation, ‘George Strickland Kingston: Pioneer and Architect’ at the
				                            Flinders University of South Australia in 1983. Choosing an academic
				                            career, Langmead was a Lecturer in Architecture at SAIT from 1967 to

				                            received the UniSA’s inaugural Postgraduate Supervisor of the Year
				                            Award. Langmead was a registered architect in South Australia between

				                            (1977-1978). In 1984 he was a foundation member of the interim committee
				                            of the Society of Architectural Historians of Australia and New Zealand
				                            (SAHANZ). He was a registered consultant with the Heritage Unit, South
				                            Australian Department of Planning and Development. His research
				                            activities have included nineteenth century South Australian
				                            architectural history, major international figures in twentieth century
				                            architecture (funded by a grant from the Graham Foundation for Advanced
				                            Studies in the Fine Arts (Chicago) 2004-2006) and especially early
				                            twentieth century Dutch architecture. That latter interest has taken him
				                            to The Netherlands on several occasions (1974-1998), and as an exchange
				                            scholar under the aegis of the Koninklijke Nederlandse Akademie voor
				                            Wetenschappen (1997). He has delivered seminar papers and public
				                            lectures on his research and published extensively producing book,

         <description type="brief" xml:lang="en"> Guy Makin
				                            (19/6/1879&amp;#8211;26/7/1970) was a committed and influential member
				                            of the South Australian Institute of Architects (SAIA) and the Royal
				                            Australian Institute of Architects (RAIA) for many years. He was known
				                            particularly for his imposing domestic architecture, generally in the
				                            Georgian style. Born into a wealthy family at Gawler, South Australia,
				                            Makin attended St Peter&amp;#8217;s College in Adelaide. He undertook
				                            articles with two Adelaide architectural firms before studying at the
				                            Architectural Association School in London. As he had independent wealth
				                            he chose to practise architecture for the love of it. From 1909 to 1927
				                            his office was at Cowra Chambers, Grenfell Street, the address of his
				                            father&amp;#8217;s business concerns. He later moved to Cavendish
				                            Chambers, 23 Grenfell Street. The RAIA&amp;#8217;s listing of South
				                            Australian Significant Twentieth-Century Architecture includes three
				                            homes in North Adelaide designed by Makin. The earliest, at 235 Ward
				                            Street (1915) is noted for its omission of ornamentation. The other two,
				                            at 70 Pennington Terrace (1927) and 117 Barnard Street
				                            (1938&amp;#8211;39), are both in the Georgian style with the former
				                            being cited as an excellent example of that era of architecture.
				                            Kingsmead House in Brougham Place, North Adelaide (1865) is listed on
				                            the South Australian State Heritage Register. Originally designed by
				                            Wright and Woods, Makin remodelled it in the 1920s without losing any of
				                            its character. As well as domestic architecture, his work includes the
				                            Mission for Seamen at Outer Harbour (1926) and a framed church at
				                            Wolseley (1928). Makin became an Associate of the SAIA in 1907 and a
				                            Fellow in 1917. In 1919 he joined the Council and fulfilled numerous
				                            roles for the next 22 years, being president from 1927 to 1929. He was
				                            one of two South Australian delegates present at the formation of the
				                            RAIA in 1929 and although not fully in favour at the outset, he later
				                            championed the cause and was president from 1935 to 1936. During his
				                            tenure, he was required to intervene over the competition of the
				                            rebuilding of St Andrew&amp;#8217;s Cathedral, Sydney, enforcing the
				                            original conditions. He became a Fellow of the Royal Institute of
				                            British Architects in 1937 and in 1940 was the inaugural chairman of the
				                            Architects&amp;#8217; Registration Board of South Australia. In 1941, a
				                            committee comprising Makin, Norman Fisher and Dean Berry considered the
				                            proposal for the SAIA to become a chapter of the RAIA. After extensive
				                            deliberation they concluded that &amp;#8216;things have worked out all
				                            right as they are&amp;#8217; and because of the fuss involved the idea
				                            was abandoned. Makin defended Traditionalism against the proponents of
				                            modern architecture such as Jack Cheesman and was unimpressed with New
				                            York skyscrapers. He held that &amp;#8216;architecture, music and
				                            painting are all governed by similar principles, and standard of beauty,
				                            all fixed and dominated by precedent and a following of tradition
				                            &amp;#8230; if you can&amp;#8217;t be original in an accepted style, you
				                            have no originality &amp;#8230; any architect, who is worth his salt, is
				                            not a mere imitator.&amp;#8217; </description>

				                            architect, took him on as a draughtsman and in 1956 Mason finally gained
				                            his registration. Between 1946 and 1948 Mason worked for the Housing
				                            Commission as a draughtsman, updating existing kitchen designs. In 1949
				                            he became an architect with the Commonwealth Department of Works in
				                            Sydney. He drew up plans and alterations for post offices in the city
				                            and suburban and rural areas; military installations in suburban and
				                            rural areas; a Qantas hangar at Mascot; and alterations to Kirribilli
				                            House. In about 1957 he became a research architect in the Department of
				                            Labour and National Service. In this position he examined conditions for
				                            factories and offices, for example the Austin Motor Company and Vicks
				                            Company, because work practices influenced building practices. He also
				                            looked at office layout with respect to function to assess how well
				                            buildings worked and studied the suitability of office furniture and
				                            equipment. On a friend&amp;#8217;s recommendation about the favourable
				                            lifestyle in Darwin, in 1960 Mason applied successfully for a job with
				                            the Department of Works in Darwin where he was put in charge of all
				                            building works in the Northern Territory with a staff of one &amp;#8211;
				                            a building inspector. He was also responsible for setting up the
				                            administrative section of the Building Board. He fought to get an
				                            engineer appointed and prepared changes to the regulations and
				                            instigated administration changes that put him in conflict with the
				                            Board. It took six years, after much wrangling and disruption in the
				                            department, to have these finally approved. Mason&amp;#8217;s
				                            responsibilities included European and Aboriginal housing; stores;
				                            administration; animal husbandry; forestry; preschool, primary and high
				                            schools; and police and gaols. He had to determine if the building was
				                            needed, exactly what it was to be used for, and then how efficiently the
				                            building could be used for a minimal cost. He worked directly on the
				                            Aboriginal settlements of Maningrida on the Arafura Sea near Arnhem Land
				                            and Papunya, about 200 miles west of Alice Springs. Both had been
				                            leprosariums and families had moved there to be near their relatives. As
				                            well, he surveyed all Aboriginal settlements of between 2000 and 12,200
				                            inhabitants to determine what was there and to make proposals for the
				                            development of water supplies, facilities generally available in small
				                            towns, potential work for residents, accommodation for staff, and
				                            stores. Settlements had developed as centres for storehouses to improve
				                            eating habits, which led to the development of hospitals and the
				                            infrastructure necessary for hygiene. Education for Aboriginals led to
				                            reasons for further settlements. As children had to learn English, the
				                            Papunya children boarded in the accommodation provided. Their parents
				                            began to camp at the school as foodstuffs disappeared from outlying
				                            areas, leading to a need for toilets, food, kitchen, and eating halls:
				                            one for men and one for women. The population survival rate of the
				                            Aboriginal inhabitants was higher than the then average because of
				                            medical assistance, which led to improved health. After Cyclone Tracy
				                            devastated Darwin in 1974, the Darwin Reconstruction Commission took
				                            control and the Works Department and Mason&amp;#8217;s job disappeared.
				                            He and his wife and family left Darwin in April 1976 to live at the
				                            Adelaide suburb of Mt Osmond. In 1986 he moved to Thirkell Street,
				                            Beaumont, building a house based on a modified Jennings plan. Mason was
				                            active in the Darwin community and was the inaugural President of its
				                            All Nations Club, formed in the late 1960s. His interest in history led
				                            him to become a founding member of the Northern Territory History
				                            Society. After he moved to Adelaide he continued to pursue his interest
				                            in history, becoming a founding member of the Burnside Historical
				                            Society. </description>

         <description type="brief" xml:lang="en"> Jack McConnell was one of the
				                            leading exponents of modern architecture to work in South Australia and
				                            the eastern states. His award winning buildings mark the first phase of
				                            modern architecture in Adelaide. McConnell&amp;#8217;s professional
				                            education as an architect began in 1930 at Melbourne University. Whilst
				                            he was studying architecture formally he worked in architects&amp;#8217;
				                            offices of Harold Desbrowe-Annear then Leighton Irwin. After graduation
				                            he moved to the office of Marcus Martin and subsequently to Edward F.
				                            Billson where he was able to design along modernist lines. He was then
				                            recruited by Philip R. Claridge, an architect from Adelaide in 1937 to
				                            work on the design of the Bank of New South Wales. In 1939 the practice
				                            became the partnership of Claridge, Hassell and McConnell. During his
				                            early years in Adelaide McConnell&amp;#8217;s designs conform to the
				                            Interwar Functionalist style. However it was in McConnell&amp;#8217;s
				                            industrial work designing factories that his functional planning skills
				                            developed. Among these were the British Australian Lead Manufacturers
				                            Pty. Ltd. (BALM) Paints factory at Port Adelaide (1946), International
				                            Harvester Company factories, service and office buildings, across
				                            Australia (1948-1950), the W.D. and H.O. Wills factory, at Southwark,
				                            South Australia (1948) and the Heinz factory at Dandenong in Victoria
				                            (1952-1955). McConnell&amp;#8217;s other main area of design expertise
				                            was in tertiary education campuses and facilities. Later, in 1970
				                            McConnell was made a partner of Stephenson and Turner and worked in
				                            Melbourne, Sydney, Adelaide, Canberra and overseas until 1980 when he
				                            retired. McConnell was active not only in the RAIA but also in the town
				                            planning field, and he received many honours and distinctions during his
				                            career. </description>

         <description type="brief" xml:lang="en"> F. Kenneth Milne
				                            (18/07/1885&amp;#8211;3/10/1980) was one of South Australia&amp;#8217;s
				                            most well-known, prolific and popular early- to mid-twentieth century
				                            architects. He resisted modernism and remained a devotee of the Georgian
				                            style throughout his life. After attending Glenelg Public School for his
				                            primary education and North Adelaide Public School for his secondary
				                            schooling, Milne received private finishing tuition. He began his
				                            architectural career around 1900 when he was articled to Alfred Wells.
				                            He then worked as a draftsman for Wells until 1906 when, against
				                            Wells&amp;#8217; advice, he moved to Sydney to seek architectural
				                            experience, working as a draftsman for Robertson &amp; Marks. When Milne
				                            returned to Adelaide in April 1909 and established his own practice, two
				                            of his first commissions influenced his early career. The Hampstead
				                            Hotel in Grote Street (1910) led the South Australian Brewing Co. Ltd to
				                            commission hotels in both metropolitan and rural areas, and the Adelaide
				                            Oval Scoreboard (1911) was so revered that the South Australian Cricket
				                            Association became a longstanding client. Over time, Milne established a
				                            reputation for domestic architecture and he designed many large
				                            residences for wealthy members of Adelaide&amp;#8217;s establishment.
				                            However, he also undertook charitable work and at the outbreak of World
				                            War One was an honorary architect for the Red Cross (S.A. Division), a
				                            role that continued into the post-war years. In 1912 Milne took on John
				                            Richard Schomburgk Evans as his first articled pupil. Evans completed
				                            his articles in 1915 but then enlisted to fight in World War One. He
				                            returned to Adelaide in 1920 and became Milne&amp;#8217;s first partner,
				                            the practice becoming F. Kenneth Milne and Evans. Milne&amp;#8217;s
				                            second articled pupil, Charles Alexander Russell, became a partner in
				                            1925. After the partnership was terminated Milne operated as a sole
				                            practitioner from 1931 until 1946. Over the following decades other
				                            partners joined Milne, including Rolfe V. Boehm (1946), Lindsay C.
				                            Dawkins (1946), Russell S. Ellis (c.1947), F.P. Bulbeck (c.mid-1950s)
				                            and John Twopeny (1960). Milne&amp;#8217;s significant Adelaide
				                            buildings include Lister House (North Terrace, 1927) and the Norwich
				                            Union Fire Insurance Society Building (Waymouth Street, 1928). Travels
				                            in Britain and Europe in 1933 awakened a keen interest in Georgian
				                            architecture, particularly the work of Robert and James Adams, and this
				                            influence can be seen in his designs for Arbury Park (c.1930s) and his
				                            own house, Sunnyside, in North Adelaide (1936). Other important
				                            buildings include Goldsbrough House (North Terrace, 1935) and the H.C.
				                            Sleigh building (Pirie Street, 1950s). While its Georgian style was
				                            criticised, the Sleigh building illustrates a significant transition
				                            point in the state&amp;#8217;s architectural history when traditional
				                            Classical designs were still considered relevant by some architects even
				                            in the face of modernism. Reluctant to embrace modernism Milne gradually
				                            retired from practice during the period from 1956 to 1962. Milne played
				                            an active role in the profession: he was President of the South
				                            Australian Institute of Architects (SAIA) from August 1937 to August
				                            1939; a founding member of the Architects&amp;#8217; Board of South
				                            Australia, which administered the Architects&amp;#8217; Act governing
				                            the registration of architects; and helped establish the Chair of
				                            Architecture at the University of Adelaide and was a member of the
				                            Faculty of Town Planning and Architecture. This association with the
				                            University was reinforced when he established the Kenneth and Hazel
				                            Milne Travelling Scholarship in Architecture for architecture students.
				                            His contribution to architecture was recognised during his lifetime: the
				                            first SAIA Award of Merit for Domestic Architecture for Sunnyside
				                            (1944), Her Majesty&amp;#8217;s Coronation Medal (1953) and Life Fellow
				                            of the Royal Australian Institute of Architects (1970). </description>

         <description type="brief" xml:lang="en"> Keith Neighbour (born 13/06/1919)
				                            is one of the first of the new breed of architects who shaped his own
				                            role as a project manager and entrepreneur. His designs show a
				                            sophisticated use and understanding of concrete as a material. Neighbour
				                            attended Victor Harbor High School and then took courses at the South
				                            Australian School of Arts and Crafts. After returning from World War
				                            Two, where he suffered appalling hardships as a POW, he studied
				                            architecture, graduating in 1952 with a Fellowship in Architectural
				                            Engineering from the South Australian School of Mines and Industries and
				                            a Bachelor of Engineering in Architecture from the University of
				                            Adelaide. Between 1948 and 1953 he was articled at Hassell and McConnell
				                            Architects. He then worked in the Architect-in-Chief&amp;#8217;s
				                            Department in South Australia before travelling to the USA as an
				                            International Fulbright Scholar. He was awarded the Albert Kahn Memorial
				                            Fellowship by the University of Pennsylvania and, in 1954, a Master of
				                            Architecture. While in the US he published articles in an Adelaide
				                            newspaper as an overseas architecture correspondent and was employed
				                            with Vincent G. Kling of Philadelphia. Back in Adelaide in 1954
				                            Neighbour joined Lawson, Cheesman and Doley. When he and three of the
				                            senior architects, R.A. Brabham, A.L. Brownell and Newell J. Platten,
				                            became partners the firm became Lawson, Cheesman, Doley and Partners.
				                            The firm grew and mutated, with new architects replacing those who
				                            retired or died, and by 1973 employed over 100 people in offices in
				                            Adelaide and Sydney; it was the largest architectural firm in South
				                            Australia and the third largest in Australia. In 1979, the firm amicably
				                            divided into three: Raffen Maron Architects; Haddrick, Harris &amp;
				                            Wyman; and KMH Neighbour &amp; Lapsys Architects Pty. Ltd., in which
				                            Keith Neighbour and Antanas Lapsys were partners. In 1987 the practice
				                            became KMH Neighbour Lapsys Pty Ltd. The work of Neighbour&amp;#8217;s
				                            practices is varied. The Highways Department building, Walkerville
				                            (1959) is a prime example of reinforced concrete with exposed structural
				                            elements, whereas Nunyara Chapel, Belair (1962) nestles within a
				                            bushland setting and uses domestic materials, form, construction and
				                            scale to integrate the spiritual with daily life. The IMFC building,
				                            King William Street, Adelaide (1964) uses prefabricated load-bearing
				                            concrete wall panels to provide an economical alternative for
				                            multi-storey construction, while St Martin&amp;#8217;s Church of
				                            England, Campbelltown (1970) shows how local materials can be used to
				                            great effect in an unusual design. Regency Park College, Regency Park
				                            (1974) comprises bold concrete forms that reflect the functions of the
				                            School of Food and Catering. Several designs have won awards: the
				                            Adelaide Kindergarten Teachers College, North Adelaide won an Award of
				                            Merit from the Royal Australian Institute of Architects (RAIA) (SA
				                            Chapter) in 1972; in 1977 the Noarlunga Regional Centre and Civic Centre
				                            received an Award of Merit from the RAIA (SA Chapter). In 1956 Neighbour
				                            chaired the committee overseeing an exhibition held in conjunction with
				                            the Sixth Australian Architectural Convention. Held in the Botanic Park,
				                            the exhibition showcased architecture by means of models and actual
				                            buildings to stimulate interest in the latest developments. Neighbour is
				                            a Life Fellow of the RAIA, after first joining the South Australian
				                            Institute of Architects as an Associate in 1952, and was awarded the
				                            RAIA (SA Chapter) President&amp;#8217;s Medal in 1994; he is also a
				                            Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects. He has been a
				                            member of the Architects Registration Board of South Australia since
				                            1979 to 1995, Chairman from 1987 to 1995, as well as fulfilling many
				                            other public roles for the profession. He has lectured at the University
				                            of Adelaide and the University of South Australia and written on
				                            architecture for the local architectural media. He received an Order of
				                            Australia in 1992 for his services to architecture. </description>

         <description type="brief" xml:lang="en"> Russell and Yelland was formed in
				                            1939 when Charles Alexander Russell and Keith Yelland formed an
				                            architectural practice. Charles Alexander Russell (Alec)
				                            (8/3/1903&amp;#8211;15/5/1975) was articled to the prominent Adelaide
				                            architect F. Kenneth Milne, in 1919, while studying at the South
				                            Australian School of Mines and Industries. Russell had many professional
				                            partnerships and collaborations. However Russell&amp;#8217;s longest and
				                            most productive partnership was with Keith Yelland. Russell &amp;
				                            Yelland was established c.1939 and still exists (2010). Over the years
				                            the partnership collaborated with others, including William Lucas.
				                            Russell&amp;#8217;s commissions were varied: the Masonic Temple at
				                            Melrose, north of Adelaide (Jacob &amp; Russell, 1928); extensions and
				                            additions to the Laura Hotel, also north of Adelaide (1929), alterations
				                            and additions to a Kensington Park residence (1929), and renovations and
				                            repairs to Lady Galway Convalescent Home at Henley Beach South (1930)
				                            (Milne, Evans and Russell); alterations and additions to a residence at
				                            College Park (C.A. Russell, 1931); two brick shops on Commercial Road,
				                            Port Adelaide (Malin Russell &amp; Co Ltd, 1932); and a new theatre at
				                            Gawler (C.A. Russell, 1934). Two projects begun in 1937 &amp;#8211; a
				                            petrol station at Dulwich and motor showrooms at Broken Hill &amp;#8211;
				                            signified the growing importance of the motor car. In 1934 Russell was
				                            an Associate of the Royal Australian Institute of Architects (SA); from
				                            1937 to 1939 he was an Associate of the South Australian Institute of
				                            Architects and in 1941 he became a Fellow. In 1940 he registered as an
				                            architect following the introduction of the Architects&amp;#8217; Act in
				                            South Australia and ten years later registered with the Architects
				                            Registration Board of Victoria. Keith Mills Yelland
				                            (25/1/1900&amp;#8211;1973) was a well-known local architect who
				                            established Russell &amp; Yelland, a prominent South Australian
				                            architectural firm that has existed for over 70 years. He was articled
				                            to local architect Charles W. Rutt from 1917 to 1921 and also studied at
				                            the Architectural Department at the South Australian School of Mines and
				                            Industries (School of Mines) and the South Australian School of Arts and
				                            Crafts. He was awarded several prizes, including Institute of
				                            Architects&amp;#8217; award for the best student in the architecture
				                            department at the School of Mines for 1919. From 1924 to 1926 Yelland
				                            worked in the Architect-in-Chief&amp;#8217;s Department. He then moved
				                            to the Commonwealth Department of Works and Housing for four years
				                            before returning to the Architect-in-Chief&amp;#8217;s Department. At
				                            this department he worked under Alfred E. Simpson, Architect-in-Chief
				                            from 1920 to 1938. Yelland also undertook private commissions, working
				                            from his own residence at 42 Clifton Street, Malvern (1927&amp;#8211;32)
				                            and then from various other premises. Yelland was an active member of
				                            the local profession. In 1922, shortly after he finished his articles
				                            and completed the required academic subjects, he became an Associate of
				                            the South Australian Institute of Architects (SAIA). He served as an
				                            SAIA Councillor for several years, acting as both Secretary and
				                            Vice-President and, from 1950 to 1952, President. He was elected a
				                            Fellow of the Royal Australian Institute of Architects (RAIA) in 1948
				                            and in 1953 attended the annual conference of the RAIA in Canberra as
				                            the South Australian delegate. One of Yelland&amp;#8217;s earliest
				                            works, with Charles Rutt, was a reinforced concrete condensing tower at
				                            Mile End (1923). Russell &amp; Yelland balanced residential commissions
				                            with commercial work, for instance a seven-roomed residence at
				                            Springfield and a factory in Grote Street, Adelaide and alterations to
				                            the Green Dragon Hotel, Adelaide (all 1939). The practice of Russell
				                            &amp; Yelland played an important role in the architectural profession
				                            during World War Two, designing and documenting Air Raid Precautions,
				                            including the conversion of both the Sir Edwin Smith Stand at Adelaide
				                            Oval and the Norwood Oval grandstand, and a privately commissioned air
				                            raid shelter at Marryatville. In the post-World War Two period the
				                            practice undertook a significant number of rural projects, particularly
				                            in Broken Hill where they then opened an office. Russell &amp; Yelland
				                            has become one of Adelaide&amp;#8217;s leading architectural practices.
				                            Its project &amp;#8216;Housing for the Aged&amp;#8217; at Woodville was
				                            praised for its sense of community and its design scheme, which had a
				                            clear expression of materials including brick, timber siding, and
				                            skillion roofs. The practice undertakes a range of educational,
				                            residential, commercial, and industrial commissions. </description>

         <description type="brief" xml:lang="en"> Colin Schumacher (born 1931)
				                            dedicated himself to public service and practised as a government
				                            architect for four decades from the mid-twentieth century. He
				                            endeavoured to raise the standard of South Australian government
				                            architecture and played an active role within the wider profession.
				                            Educated at Blackwood Primary School and Unley High School, Schumacher
				                            commenced his architectural studies in 1949. He won many awards and
				                            graduated in 1954 with a Bachelor of Engineering (Architectural) from
				                            the University of Adelaide in addition to a Fellowship Diploma in
				                            Architecture from the South Australian School of Mines. In the late
				                            1940s and early 1950s local architectural education underwent a
				                            canonical change when the more mature ex-servicemen who became students
				                            after World War Two encouraged their younger colleagues to explore
				                            modernism rather than follow the Beaux-Arts tradition. Schumacher
				                            embraced the new style and, when head of the Architectural Students
				                            Association, helped organise the Drawing Exchange Scheme that toured
				                            student drawings around Australia, effectively disseminating this
				                            change. In 1957 he was awarded the Albert Kahn Memorial Fellowship for
				                            postgraduate study at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, USA
				                            and in 1958 received his Master of Architecture from that university.
				                            While still a student Schumacher became a cadet with the Commonwealth
				                            Department of Works where he remained for most of his career. After
				                            graduating, he was predominantly involved in the design development and
				                            documentation phases of projects and from 1960 he focused on contract
				                            administration. When the Department was restructured in the 1970s, with
				                            more emphasis being placed on project management, he became the first
				                            resources manager and subsequently acted as project manager, technical
				                            services manager and, from 1989 until his retirement in 1992, Principal
				                            Architect. Schumacher&amp;#8217;s work includes some projects of
				                            national importance and massive scale: the development of Woomera Rocket
				                            Range and township (c.1950); the Adelaide Airport developments at West
				                            Beach (1955&amp;#8211;85) &amp;#8211; one of Schumacher&amp;#8217;s
				                            first projects after graduating; the design and documentation of two
				                            large laboratory complexes for the CSIRO Division of Soils at Urrbrae
				                            (1956&amp;#8211;60); contract administration of the Reserve Bank
				                            building &amp;#8211; the then tallest building in Adelaide
				                            (1963&amp;#8211;7), including underground extensions (1976); a
				                            widespread program of new telephone exchanges, lighthouses, post offices
				                            and regional office buildings (1955&amp;#8211;85); restoration of the
				                            Adelaide GPO Postal Hall (1986); and the Garden of Remembrance, Pasadena
				                            (1987). Schumacher was active in the profession. In 1952 he joined the
				                            South Australian Institute of Architects (later Royal Australian
				                            Institute of Architects) as a student member, in 1955 he became an
				                            Associate and in 1970 a Fellow. He served on the SA Chapter Council for
				                            13 years, the last four of which he was Vice-President. In recognition
				                            of his service to the profession he was made a Life Fellow in 1987. His
				                            public activities included illustrated lectures on world architecture
				                            and civic design for the South Australian Libraries Board and guest
				                            lectures at the University of Adelaide on subjects including the
				                            architectural philosophies of Louis Kahn, and project management. He
				                            published several articles in local architecture journals. </description>

         <description type="brief" xml:lang="en"> Marjorie Constance White
				                            (17/6/1924&amp;#8211;27/1/2003) was the daughter of architect Charles
				                            Arthur Mortimer White. She enrolled in the architecture course at Sydney
				                            Technical College in 1941, graduating in 1948. While a student she
				                            worked in the architectural office of Eric Nicholls and was involved in
				                            a variety of projects, including a small cosmetics factory, a coffee
				                            shop, a baby health clinic and numerous houses. She became a registered
				                            architect in NSW in 1949 and in the same year married fellow architect
				                            Peter Simpson (1924&amp;#8211;1992), changing her surname to Simpson.
				                            Marjorie worked for the Commonwealth Department of Works in Sydney from
				                            1950 where her projects included migrant holding facilities near Wagga
				                            and near Singleton that incorporated childcare and maternity facilities.
				                            Peter Simpson (9/6/1924&amp;#8211;11/12/1992) completed his schooling in
				                            Sydney. In 1942 he was accepted into the Sydney Technical
				                            College&amp;#8217;s six-year architectural course and was articled to
				                            Peddle Thorpe and Walker. He graduated in 1949 with credits, becoming an
				                            Associate of the Royal Australian Institute of Architects (RAIA). In
				                            1949 he married fellow student Marjorie White who had also completed the
				                            architectural course. After graduating he joined Kenwood Hoile
				                            Architects, and then in 1951 moved to the Commonwealth Department of
				                            Works where Marjorie worked. Marjorie and Peter moved to Adelaide in
				                            1951 to work on the design and documentation of the Woomera Rocket Range
				                            for the Commonwealth Department of Works, at the same time designing
				                            their home in Adelaide. In 1954 they spent nearly five months travelling
				                            through Europe and England and were then employed by Sir Thomas Bennett
				                            &amp; Son&amp;#8217;s office in London from 1955 to 1956. Returning to
				                            Adelaide they worked for the S.A. Brewing Company. In 1957 Marjorie
				                            Simpson became Director of the Small Homes Service of South Australia.
				                            In the same year Peter Simpson and Kenneth W. Shepherd formed Shepherd
				                            and Simpson. When Shepherd retired in 1969, Marjorie became a partner
				                            and the practice became Simpson and Simpson. It undertook a variety of
				                            work, from domestic to banks and retail, with the largest commission
				                            being the Royal Society for the Blind Institute at Gilles Plains. The
				                            partnership helped to introduce brick veneer construction and concrete
				                            slab floors to South Australia and provided a modern aesthetic to
				                            domestic construction. Marjorie retired from practice in 1989 although
				                            she continued to undertake small projects. Marjorie Simpson was the
				                            first female to be made a Life Fellow of the RAIA in South Australia.
				                            She was also convenor of the Housing Committee of the National Council
				                            of Women. She lectured on matters such as zoning, ceiling heights,
				                            drafting standards and uniform regulations to the Association of Local
				                            Government Building Surveyors. She was a regular guest on ABC radio and
				                            appeared on the first television program for women. She had a passionate
				                            interest in designing homes for the women who had to live and work in
				                            them. She published articles in newspapers and magazines and wrote the
				                            Home Builders Handbook that provided information to homebuilders on
				                            subjects ranging from design to finance. The partnership helped to
				                            introduce brick veneer construction and concrete slab floors to South
				                            Australia and provided a modern aesthetic to domestic construction.
				                            Peter was also awarded a Life Fellowship of the RAIA. </description>

         <description type="brief" xml:lang="en"> Louis Edouard Laybourne Smith
				                            (1/4/1880&amp;#8211;13/9/1965) was a prominent South Australian
				                            architect who established South Australia&amp;#8217;s first School of
				                            Architecture. Architecture was his profession, his hobby, indeed his
				                            obsession: he died at his office desk. Laybourne Smith was born at Unley
				                            and his primary and secondary education were undertaken at Whinham and
				                            Way Colleges. Initially articled to A.A.E. Dancker in Kalgoorlie, WA, he
				                            studied mechanical engineering at the South Australian School of Mines
				                            and Industries (School of Mines) when he returned to Adelaide in 1898,
				                            gaining an Associate Diploma in 1902. Between 1901 and 1904 he was
				                            articled to Edward Davies and in 1908 graduated with a Bachelor of
				                            Engineering from the University of Adelaide. He initially worked as a
				                            draftsman and in 1903 lectured in mechanical engineering at the School
				                            of Mines; from 1905 to 1914 he was Registrar of the School of Mines. In
				                            the absence of a course in architecture at either the University of
				                            Adelaide or the School of Mines, in 1905 he initiated his own, with the
				                            course being formalised in 1906 as a part-time Diploma in Architecture.
				                            In 1914 he joined one of Adelaide&amp;#8217;s most influential
				                            architectural firms, Woods, Bagot and Jory, becoming a partner of Woods,
				                            Bagot, Jory and Laybourne Smith in 1915. In 1930 James Irwin was made
				                            partner and the firm became Woods, Bagot, Laybourne Smith and Irwin
				                            (Herbert Jory established his own practice). Laybourne Smith remained
				                            head of the architecture course at the School of Mines until 1951, when
				                            his former pupil Gavin Walkley took over on a full-time basis. Laybourne
				                            Smith continued his association with the school until his death at 85.
				                            His architectural designs included his own house at Northgate Street,
				                            Unley Park (1911), considered &amp;#8216;startlingly modern when it was
				                            built&amp;#8217;, the Hosking residence, Hawker&amp;#8217;s Road,
				                            Medindie (1924) and the Wardle residence, West Terrace, Kensington
				                            (1927). His ecclesiastical commissions included a chapel for the
				                            Dominican Cabra Convent at Goodwood (1914), St Cuthbert&amp;#8217;s
				                            Church of England, Prospect (1914) and the rebuilding of St
				                            Paul&amp;#8217;s Retreat, Glen Osmond (1920s). Other work included the
				                            design of buildings at Calvary Hospital, North Adelaide, the original
				                            Students&amp;#8217; Union Building and cloisters (1927) at the
				                            University of Adelaide, and the red brick Bonython Jubilee Building at
				                            the School of Mines (now University of South Australia), Frome Road,
				                            Adelaide (1937). He collaborated with Walter Bagot and Sydney sculptor
				                            Rayner Hoff in the design of the South Australian National War Memorial
				                            on the corner of North Terrace and Kintore Avenue, Adelaide (completed
				                            1931). Laybourne Smith was renowned for his contribution to the
				                            profession. He was an Associate of the South Australian Institute of
				                            Architects (SAIA) from 1904, Fellow from 1907. Elected to the SAIA
				                            Council in 1909, he served in various capacities including President
				                            from 1921 to 1923 and 1935 to 1937. He was integral to the formation of
				                            a national body of architects and was a founding member of the Federal
				                            Council of the Australian Institutes of Architects (President, 1919 to
				                            1922). He was a Councillor of the Royal Australian Institute of
				                            Architects (RAIA) (1933 to 1944) and President (1937 to 1938) and was
				                            awarded the RAIA&amp;#8217;s Life Fellowship in 1944; his professional
				                            achievements were recognised nationally in 1961 with the
				                            RAIA&amp;#8217;s Gold Medal. He was appointed a Fellow of the Royal
				                            Institute of British Architects in 1939 and made a Life Fellow in 1944.
				                            He was awarded the CMG in 1948. He advised on the drafting of the South
				                            Australian Building Act 1923, described as a
				                            &amp;#8216;revolutionary&amp;#8217; piece of legislation, and
				                            contributed to the framing of the Architects&amp;#8217; Act 1939. He
				                            served as a member of the administering body for the Act and of the
				                            Architects&amp;#8217; Board of South Australia and was Architectural
				                            Advisor to the South Australian Committee of the War Damage Commission
				                            in 1944. </description>

         <description type="brief" xml:lang="en"> The South Australian Centre for
				                            Settlement Studies is an incorporated body set up under the aegis of the
				                            Councils of the South Australian College of Advanced Education (SACAE)
				                            and the South Australian Institute of Technology (SAIT). The research
				                            collaboration between the College and the Institute was formalised in
				                            April 1982 by the incorporation of the Centre. The Centre was controlled
				                            by a Board of eleven members, chaired by Graeme Pretty, Senior Curator,
				                            SA Museum, and is directed by Gordon Young, Senior Lecturer in
				                            Architecture, School of Architecture and Building at the SA Institute of
				                            Technology (Jim Faull, Senior Lecturer in Geographical Studies, SACAE,
				                            was the acting Director during 1984). It was launched upon the
				                            foundation of a successful collaboration between Ian Harmstorf, Senior
				                            Lecturer in History, SACAE and Gordon Young, Senior Lecturer in
				                            Architecture SAIT in the production of the Barossa Survey (1976-1977).
				                            That survey examined the patterns of German settlement in the Barossa
				                            Valley in the nineteenth century. It was one of the first heritage
				                            surveys funded under the National Estate Programme set up late in 1975.
				                            Apart from the architectural and historical research that was
				                            undertaken, a survey was also made of the physical geography of the
				                            district by Roger Smith, Lecturer in Geography at the SACAE. The
				                            research group then went on to study the early German settlement of
				                            Hahndorf in the Adelaide Hills, a project funded by the newly formed
				                            Australian Heritage Commission (1977). The township's historical
				                            development was studied as well as that of its surrounding hamlets,
				                            including Paechtown. A major feature of the survey was the measurement
				                            and delineation of all the buildings on both sides of the main street of
				                            Hahndorf and several nearby large farmhouses and barns. In order clearly
				                            to understand the nature of the settlement and it's buildings, the
				                            settlers' historical European backgrounds were carefully researched
				                            (viz. Their village life, farmhouses and outbuildings and patterns of
				                            settlement). The information obtained from the Barossa and Hahndorf
				                            surveys clearly highlighted the importance of German settlement in the
				                            early rural history of South Australia. To complete the research of
				                            major German settlements, two more projects have since been undertaken.
				                            Lobethal and its environs was studied between 1980 and 1982 and Birdwood
				                            (formerly Blumberg) between 1982 and 1984. Michael Butler, then Lecturer
				                            in Geography, SACAE, studied the physical geography of the Lobethal
				                            district and Jim Faull, Senior Lecturer in Geographical Studies, SACAE
				                            was responsible for a similar study of the Birdwood area. The Centre has
				                            recently completed a study of the Onkaparinga Council District. The
				                            Upper Onkaparinga Valley is an area of the Adelaide Hills which, as well
				                            as being settled by German immigrants, had a large Scottish enclave
				                            during its first twenty years of settlement. It was one of the first
				                            parts of the state to be settled outside of the metropolitan area (e.g.
				                            Balhannah, 1839 and Lobethal, 1842). Both it and the adjoining council
				                            districts of Gumeracha, Mount Pleasant and Mount Barker still retain
				                            many pioneer buildings and historic precincts from this early period of
				                            settlement. Centre Activities The area of research with which the Centre
				                            was concerned covers the broad spectrum of European settlement in
				                            Australia, and in particular: History: both social and economic;
				                            Geography; land forms and uses and economic developments; Architecture;
				                            the transfer of cultural heritages into Australia in the form of
				                            building types and their related construction; Planning; the form of
				                            early settlements, their origins and the development which took place in
				                            the nineteenth and twentieth centuries; Conservation; methods of
				                            conservation related to both the natural and adapted environment and
				                            individual historical architectural precincts of individual buildings.

				                            as draughtsman and it is probable that he drew the original plan of
				                            Adelaide. When Kingston left the colony for England Thomas then gained
				                            employment as a draughtsman in the government Survey Office and drafted
				                            the first official map of Adelaide. On the return of Kingston to
				                            Adelaide in June 1838 the staff of the Survey Office collectively
				                            resigned under the mistaken belief that Kingston had censured them
				                            whilst in London. Thomas then gained employment as a draughtsman with
				                            Light, Finnis &amp; Co., a company formed by the disgruntled surveyors.
				                            The practice lasted only a short while and following the death of
				                            Colonel William Light dissolved in September 1839. During this time
				                            Thomas worked principally on land subdivisions. In 1839 Thomas returned
				                            to work for Kingston, principally as a clerk. In 1841 Kingston began
				                            work for the Adelaide Corporation as Town Surveyor and Rates Collector
				                            with Thomas as his assistant. In 1842 a windmill on West Terrace,
				                            Adelaide for H.W. Phillips may have been Thomas&amp;#8217; first built
				                            work, however he left Kingston in 1843 and following some lean years in
				                            the colony formed a partnership with William Parry James in January 1845
				                            with the result of the practice gaining some small commissions. During
				                            the mining boom of the 1840s James and Thomas gained some work for
				                            Adelaide Mining Association undertaking mineral surveys before they
				                            decided to return to Britain. When Thomas and James returned to Britain
				                            in 1846 they practised for some years in Newport, Wales where Thomas was
				                            involved with over fifty projects, amongst which were villas, chapels,
				                            offices and shops, principally in the Gothic style. Thomas married
				                            Charlotte Annanette Shum Tuckett in 1856 whist in Britain and they had
				                            two children before returning to Adelaide in June 1861. They had a
				                            further seven children over the ensuing decade, two of whom died in
				                            infancy. Thomas became engaged for some time in private practice
				                            designing many large public and private buildings and was made a Fellow
				                            of the Royal British Institute of Architects in December 1866. In July
				                            1866 he was appointed as Assistant Government Architect and in 1868,
				                            Government Architect. The office was abolished in 1870 and Thomas
				                            resumed private practice, continuing to work predominantly in Italianate
				                            or Gothic Revival styles. After the 1873 Health Act was passed Thomas
				                            was appointed Secretary of the Central Board of Health, a position he
				                            held from 1874 until his death on 14 April 1883. Thomas&amp;#8217; first
				                            commission on his return to Adelaide in 1861 was the Gothic style
				                            bluestone and sandstone Flinders Street Baptist Church, Adelaide,
				                            followed by the Italianate styled Alberton Baptist Church (1863), the
				                            Italian Gothic warehouses in King William Street, Adelaide for Thomas
				                            Johnson, constructed of Glen Osmond stone with freestone columns (1865),
				                            the substantial Matthew Goode Residence on the corner of Wakefield and
				                            Hutt Streets, Adelaide (now demolished) and Stow Memorial Congregational
				                            Church, Flinders Street, Adelaide in early French Gothic style (1866).
				                            He also designed the Register Chambers (1865) for his family&amp;#8217;s
				                            newspaper and printing business, Adelaide. As Assistant and the
				                            Government Architect between 1866 and 1870, Thomas designed Mt Gambier
				                            Hospital (1867-9), the Supreme Court Buildings, Adelaide (1867) and the
				                            Parkside Lunatic Asylum (later called Glenside Hospital) (1868),
				                            Greenhill Road, Glenside. When he returned to private practice
				                            commissions included St Augustine&amp;#8217;s Church, Unley Road, Unley
				                            (1869) in English Gothic style, the Bagster House (1872), Unley Road,
				                            Unley, and the Port Adelaide Institute (1875), Commercial Road, Port
				                            Adelaide in Venetian Italian style and constructed of Dry Creek rubble
				                            stone. </description>

         <description type="brief" xml:lang="en"> Laurence (Laurie) Wyman was born at
				                            Barmera, South Australia on the 2nd of November 1929 to Charles and
				                            Florence Isabel Wyman. He attended Barmera Primary School and Glossop
				                            High School before moving to Adelaide in 1946 and commenced the
				                            Associate Diploma course in Architecture at the South Australia School
				                            of Mines and Industries. After completing two years full time study,
				                            Wyman obtained a job and continued his studies part time. He graduated
				                            with an Associate Diploma in Architecture in 1957. Laurie Wyman obtained
				                            a position in 1948 as a junior draftsman with Lawson Cheesman and Doley.
				                            He then moved to a job with the South Australian Housing Trust as an
				                            Architectural Draftsman in 1950. Eighteen months later Wyman was offered
				                            back his position at Lawson Cheesman and Doley which he took. In 1958,
				                            he was appointed an Associate of the firm, in charge of the Mount
				                            Gambier office, and in 1961 became a Director/Partner. When the Cheesman
				                            Doley Neighbour and Raffen (originally Lawson Cheesman and Doley)
				                            amicably divided in 1978, Wyman joined the firm Haddrick Harris Wyman
				                            Architects where he worked for a further 9 years. In 1987, one of the
				                            firms&amp;#8217; partners expressed his wish to retire, and so the doors
				                            to Haddick Harris Wyman Architects closed. Wyman however continued to
				                            work from home as a sole practitioner until his retirement from
				                            architectural practice in 1992. Wyman worked on many different project
				                            types such as banks, offices, warehouses, churches, cinemas and
				                            residences. Notable Works include the Remark Hotel, Barmera Hotel,
				                            Kingsway Motors, Johnson &amp; Johnson Warehouse, Civic Theatre,
				                            Millicent District Hospital, Barmera District Hospital, Kingston
				                            Hospital, Alice Springs Hospital, Flinders Medical Centre and the
				                            Booleroo Centre Hospital. Wyman was both a Fellow of the Royal
				                            Australian Institute of Architects and an Associate of the Royal
				                            Institute of British Architects. </description>

         <description type="brief" xml:lang="en"> Gordon Young was a Senior Lecturer
				                            in Architecture at the South Australian Institute of Technology (SAIT,
				                            later University of South Australia (UniSA) where he founded and
				                            organised the South Australian Centre for Settlement Studies. Young
				                            began his career in architecture in the United Kingdom. From 1944 to
				                            1947 he was articled to Mr Dobson Chapman and Associates, regional
				                            planners, architects and surveyors, while studying architecture at the
				                            University of Manchester. After graduating in 1949 he became an
				                            architectural associate with A.R. Johnson and Associates in Manchester
				                            where he designed government housing and small industrial buildings. He
				                            worked as an architectural assistant at RA Risley between 1950 and 1956
				                            and then moved to Adelaide where he worked in the Architect-in-Chief's
				                            Department designing high schools and teachers? colleges. From 1959 to
				                            1960 he undertook postgraduate research at the French Ministry of
				                            Construction and was awarded a French Government Diploma in
				                            Architecture. In 1960 he was appointed Lecturer in Architecture and
				                            Building at the School of Architecture, SAIT, Senior Lecturer in 1970.
				                            He continued his architectural work, designing an alcohol and drug
				                            rehabilitation centre at Port Adelaide (1970&amp;#8211;75), a medical
				                            centre at the University of Adelaide (1983) and an orthopaedic clinic at
				                            the Wakefield Medical Centre, Adelaide (1991). In 1976 Young and Ian
				                            Harmstorf, Senior Lecturer in History at the Adelaide College of
				                            Advanced Education, were awarded a National Estate grant to study
				                            patterns of German settlement in the Barossa Valley. This unique
				                            association between the two educational institutions developed into the
				                            South Australian Centre for Settlement Studies (SACSS) in 1982 with
				                            Young as the inaugural director of research. Further grants from the
				                            Australian Heritage Commission supported studies of the Adelaide Hills
				                            settlements of Hahndorf, Lobethal and Birdwood and their surrounding
				                            areas. Young and members of the Centre published numerous heritage
				                            survey reports, monographs and research papers as well as gave papers at
				                            local and international conferences. Young was elected Associate of the
				                            Royal Institute of British Architects in 1950, and is a member of
				                            Australian ICOMOS and of the Vernacular Architecture Group of the United
				                            Kingdom. He has served on the Council of the Royal Australian Institute
				                            of Architects (SA Chapter) and Chairman of its Historic Matters
				                            Committee; he was elected Fellow in 1970. He was Chairman of the Civic
				                            Trust of South Australia. After his retirement from SAIT in 1987 Young
				                            continued to direct the SACSS until its closure in 1989. He was a
				                            Visiting Fellow at Flinders University from 1987 to 1991 giving lectures
				                            in nineteenth-century architecture to visual arts and archaeology
				                            students. </description>

				                            Exhibition held 26 May to 16 June 1956 in the Adelaide Parklands. Staged
				                            by the South Australian Institute of Architecture and the Royal
				                            Australian Institute of Architects, in conjunction with the Sixth
				                            Australian Architectural Convention, the exhibition was designed to
				                            foster interest in the latest developments in architecture through
				                            models and buildings. Botanic Park was the site for pavilions intended
				                            to show ‘how beauty and logic can be combined to make more pleasing
				                            surroundings for daily living’. The exhibition was covered in national

				                            overseas press. The Architectural Convention and exhibition of 1956
				                            changed architecture in Adelaide and beyond, introducing contemporary
				                            architecture to the South Australian public. Includes enlarged printed
				                            photographic panels from the 1998 retrospective exhibition, as well as

				                            CV for Boas from 1904; a curriculum vitae from 1975; and his
				                            reminiscences from 1965. Before Architecture became a subject for
				                            University education, potential architects were apprenticed to
				                            practising architects. The indentures were a legal document binding both
				                            parties to complete the education of the apprentice. Donated by Mrs
				                            Marjorie Luno, daughter of Harold Boas.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; </description>

         <description type="full"> &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Contains a single series of research
				                            material donated by Dr H. David Chamberlain. Over several years Dr H.D.
				                            Chamberlain has made a series of donations of prints, and books
				                            containing prints, to the Architecture Museum. The total holding of this
				                            collection is over 4000 prints and over 100 books. While the focus of
				                            this collection is architecture, it is diverse, and it is also
				                            significant as a resource of British and European history and art of the
				                            18th and 19th (and to a lesser extent 17th and 20th) centuries. The main
				                            counties of origin are Britain, France, Italy, Germany, Flanders and
				                            Holland. The historical aspects of the collection are obvious, but are
				                            even more pertinent because a large proportion of the prints show human
				                            activity as well as buildings. A few series depict events. Most of the
				                            main methods of print-making are well-represented: engravings (copper
				                            and steel), etchings, aquatints, lithographs, and chromo-lithographs.
				                            Fine early photographic reproduction is also present. Most of the prints
				                            are in good condition, including some with added water-colouring and the
				                            quality of engraving in some architectural prints is exceptionally fine.
				                            Some series may be considered more as art than of architecture, such as
				                            many of the British “picturesque” scenes of the 1780-1850s. Yet other
				                            19th century prints, though architectural, have an expressive quality.

         <description type="full"> &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Carnegie Art Reference Set for
				                            Colleges provides a photographic history of art and, in its entirety,
				                            contains 1,500 high quality reproduction photographs, coloured prints
				                            and facsimiles, and 200 specially written reference books. The
				                            collection is separated into several portfolios of period, including
				                            classical, medieval, Renaissance and modern; and medium, such as
				                            architecture, sculpture, painting, handicraft and textiles. The
				                            Architecture Museum only holds the architecture portfolio of the set.
				                            Each image has a fully descriptive label (and unique number which
				                            corresponded with handbook details- not avaliable at UniSA). Between
				                            1927 and 1941 the CCNY distributed 69 Art Reference Sets amongst various
				                            learning institutions throughout the British Commonwealth, one of which
				                            was gifted to the University of Adelaide in 1939 at a cost of $5,000
				                            (this is the partial set now housed at UniSA). The art reference set
				                            provided many of Australia's inadequately resourced learning
				                            institutions with arts teaching materials, and was further found to
				                            improve the teaching of English Literature and History.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; </description>

				                            Notes on plans in the Milne Collection: • Plans dated 1921, 22, 23 seems
				                            to be drawn by Milne himself, most are drawn by other members of the
				                            firm. • Some of the earlier plans are hand tinted by Milne. • Job
				                            numbers do not always indicate sequence of jobs over time • Item numbers
				                            do not always indicate any particular order • Plans mostly for wealthy
				                            clients or larger firms • Plans originally came in large brown envelopes
				                            with a number on the front and the name of the client. This number is
				                            reflected on the card index. • Materials in the collection vary and
				                            include plain newspaper, tracing and tissue paper, linen, butter paper,
				                            cartridge paper, ozalids and blueprints. • Some plans are in very poor
				                            condition, some had to be buffered due to acidic properties or sticky
				                            adhesives. Many are folded and creased.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; </description>

         <description type="brief" xml:lang="en">Manager Water Treatment and Distribution Research</description>
         <description type="full" xml:lang="en">Mary Drikas is the Manager of the Water Treatment and Distribution team within Research and Innovation Services in SA Water. She has been leading water treatment studies in the Australian Water Quality Centre since 1987 and has over 30 years experience in this field. She was also the Program Leader of the Water Technology Program nationally within the Cooperative Research Centre for Water Quality and Treatment, from when it was formally established in July 1995 to its official completion in June 2008. She has been involved in research of a variety of processes including coagulation, disinfection, activated carbon and more recently membrane systems. She is a co-patent holder for the application of magnetic anion exchange resin (MIEX) for the removal of natural organic matter. She has also lead projects developing methods for determining assimilable organic carbon and characterising natural organic matter. In recent years this has lead to the obvious link with distribution system management and developing better understanding and tools to control these two inter-related fields. She has co-authored over 100 scientific papers.</description>

				                            15 years David has been involved in numerous urban stormwater projects
				                            specifically incorporating innovative Water Sensitive Urban Design
				                            concepts. He was involved in the development of a national handbook on
				                            WSUD source control and is co-author of two chapters in the Australian
				                            Runoff Water Quality (Institution of Engineers, Aust) document and

				                            Australian South East region. In the past David has worked with Planning
				                            SA and councils in developing PAR guidelines for stormwater management
				                            and the Water Sensitive Urban Design Guidelines for the Greater Adelaide
				                            Region. David was the project leader for the Water Proofing the Northern
				                            Adelaide Region research program and led two water flow measurement
				                            projects for the CRC for Irrigation Futures. More recently he led the
				                            Interim WSUD Target and WSUD Impediments (Phase 1) Projects for the
				                            Goyder Institute.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; </description>

				                            in 2006, he completed his PhD in 2010 based on a study of the physical,
				                            chemical and biological processes affecting stormwater quality in
				                            permeable pavement structures.&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;His current

				                            especially in urban areas, there is increased demand for water supplies
				                            for all types of uses. Urban stormwater is a relatively untapped
				                            resource that could help us meet future water supply demands. If natural
				                            aquifers (any geological formation capable of receiving, storing and
				                            transmitting significant quantities of water) are present beneath a
				                            city, they may be used for convenient storage and additional treatment
				                            of urban stormwater. The MARSUO project used Adelaide as a case study
				                            and provided the South Australian Government with information to
				                            confidently assess the range of stormwater use options for the city,

         <description type="full"> &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Judith Helen Ford is a geneticist who has
				                            a long research history in human reproduction, cancer and ageing. She
				                            graduated with a first class Honours degree in Science (Genetics) in
				                            1967 and her PhD was awarded in 1971. Her work has included studies on
				                            the mechanisms of error during cell division and diagnostic research on
				                            mutation and chromosomal structural and numerical changes underlying
				                            cancers and human developmental abnormalities. In the late 1980’s she
				                            and her team undertook a unique, community-based study of the
				                            environmental and lifestyle abnormalities affecting natural fertility
				                            and pregnancy loss.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;Dr Ford’s ongoing
				                            major research focus is in defining the mechanisms underlying ageing
				                            within the reproductive system and whole body ageing. She is undertaking
				                            a SANT datalinkage project (linking the Cervical Cancer database with
				                            the Perinatal Statistics database) to confirm findings made in her
				                            community-based study that define key risks for ‘tiny’ babies (SGA =
				                            small for gestational age) as season of conception and papilloma
				                            infection. This work links to her models of ageing since SGA babies have
				                            premature onset of diabetes and other diseases of ageing.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
				                            &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;Judy’s research is currently only a very small part
				                            of her work, which mainly involves offering educational programs and
				                            support to UniSA’s PhD students in the Science and Engineering
				                            faculties.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; </description>

				                            1988 to 1993 in response to extensive promotion in the local media. Male
				                            and female partners were interviewed independently and all interviews
				                            were conducted prospectively before the couple attempted to conceive.
				                            The result of each month of ‘trying’ was recorded and pregnancies were
				                            confirmed by urine tests and by ultrasound. The length of gestation of

				                            abnormalities have been excluded from the dataset. The data is stored as
				                            an xls file and each variable has a codename. For each of 582 couples
				                            there are 355 variables, the codes for which are described in a separate
				                            metadata file. The questionnaire based data includes information about
				                            households, occupation, chemical exposures at work and home, diet,
				                            smoking, alcohol use, hobbies, exercise and health. Recorded

         <description type="brief" xml:lang="en">Pro Vice Chancellor : Information Technology, Engineering and the Environment</description>
         <description type="full" xml:lang="en">Simon commenced as Pro Vice-Chancellor of the Division of Information Technology, Engineering and the Environment (ITEE) in January 2015. Prior to this he was Head of the School of Natural and Built Environments (2010 - 2014) and before that he was the Director of UniSA's Centre for Water Management and Reuse (2006 - 2010). The Division of ITEE is recognised as a world-leader in teaching and research and has received a range of accolades for outstanding education, student and graduate satisfaction, and world-class research. These include being ranked as the only university in South Australia in the World Top 100 (in position 69) for Engineering and Technology in the 2014-15 Times Higher Education World University Rankings. The Division has over 300 full-time academic staff and more than 420 PhD students.
				In terms of his own personal research, Simon has been awarded (as Chief Investigator) seven Australian Research Council (ARC) Discovery, Linkage and LIEF grants in the past ten years and he has three current ARC grants. His research is outcome-focused and in particular he believes we need to be more sustainable in the management of our water resources. To this end, he has through his research been the author of industry available tools such as the Syfon and Switch2 software programs.
				The Syfon model has been used to design the siphonic roofwater harvesting systems at the Sydney Olympic Stadium, the Sydney Cricket Ground, the MCG and the new Adelaide Oval. It has also been used to design the roof drainage systems at the Hong Kong, Kuala Lumpur, Sydney and Adelaide airports. In terms of iconic Australian buildings, the Syfon software has been used in the design of the Federation Square and Docklands developments in Melbourne as well as the new Royal Adelaide Hospital (RAH) and the Adelaide Convention Centre.
				In addition to these industry contributions, Simon has been a Board Director of Water Research Australia Ltd (WaterRA) since 2009, having been successfully re-elected in both the 2011 and 2013 Board elections. WaterRA is Australia's longest-running private company (2009 - present) that has made the successful transition from being a former CRC (1995-2008).
				Simon is a Fellow of Engineers Australia as well as a Fellow of the Australian Institute of Company Directors.</description>

				                            which he graduated in 1961 with an Honours degree in Electrical
				                            Engineering. A lifelong interest in architectural history crystallised
				                            in the early 1970s into an in depth investigation of the nature and
				                            scope of the Gothic Revival in Australia. In 1982 Brian was invited to
				                            read a paper on the Gothic Revival in South Australian church
				                            architecture at a seminar on South Australian religious history convened
				                            by the Flinders University History Discipline. Arising from this work
				                            came an invitation to curate the University's exhibition, 'Gothic in

				                            will be remembered as a leader in the trend to modernism in South
				                            Australia and for his role in the professionalisation of architecture in
				                            the 1930s and 1940s. Cheesman studied architecture at the South
				                            Australian School of Mines and Industries and School of Arts from 1923
				                            to 1926, concurrently working for the Architect-in-Chief’s Department
				                            under George Gavin Lawson, an important influence on the younger
				                            generation of architects. After working for two years at McMichael and
				                            Harris in Adelaide he furthered his architectural studies in New York
				                            while working in the large practice of York and Sawyer. In 1931,
				                            following six months’ study and sketching in Europe, he returned to
				                            Adelaide, becoming a partner in Gavin Lawson and Cheesman in January
				                            1932. During World War Two he designed war-related buildings in Adelaide
				                            and Darwin. In 1946 Maurice Doley joined Lawson and Cheesman and the new
				                            firm of Lawson, Cheesman and Doley undertook both architectural and
				                            engineering commissions. Lawson retired in 1952 and in 1954 Keith
				                            Neighbour joined the firm, it becoming Lawson, Cheesman, Doley and
				                            Partners when he and three of the senior architects, R.A. Brabham, A.L.
				                            Brownell and Newell J. Platten, became partners. The firm grew and
				                            mutated, with new architects replacing those who retired or died, and by
				                            1973 it employed over 100 people in offices in Adelaide and Sydney; it
				                            was the largest architectural firm in South Australia and the third
				                            largest in Australia. Commercial buildings that Cheesman’s firm designed
				                            include Holden’s administration building at Woodville (1926) and the
				                            Ridley Memorial Entrance, Wayville Showgrounds. During the 1930s the
				                            firm designed Greater Union cinemas in Perth, Sydney and Townsville. In
				                            association with Bates Smart McCutcheon, Cheesman supervised the
				                            construction of the MLC Building, Victoria Square, Adelaide. Other
				                            commercial buildings in the Adelaide CBD overseen by the firm included
				                            BP House, the Guardian Insurance Building and the IMFC Building.
				                            Suburban residential projects included a block of flats at Millswood and
				                            a two-storey dwelling at Cumberland Park displaying the modern style. He
				                            designed buildings at Flinders University and the University of
				                            Adelaide, the last being the Law School at the University of Adelaide
				                            (1967). He also designed two churches of distinction, St Saviours Church
				                            of England at Glen Osmond and Colonel Light Gardens Church of England
				                            (1958). Cheesman was an active member of Institutes of Architects. After
				                            joining the South Australian Institute of Architects as an Associate in
				                            1926, he was a member of Council from 1932 to 1952 (Treasurer, 1932;
				                            Honorary Secretary, 1937–40; President, 1945–47). When the state-based
				                            institutes federated to form the Royal Australian Institute of
				                            Architects (RAIA), he was a Federal Councillor (1946–52) and Federal
				                            President (1948–50). In 1950 he was made a Fellow of the Royal Institute
				                            of British Architects and in 1968 was awarded a Life Fellowship of the
				                            RAIA. He was a Life Fellow of the Royal Australian Planning Institute
				                            and in 1970 was made an Affiliate of the Australian Institute of
				                            Building. His influence on the profession was extensive, his initiatives
				                            including the Small Homes Service of South Australia, which provided
				                            architecturally designed houses to the public for a nominal fee; the
				                            South Australian Architects’ Act, which instituted the registration of
				                            Architects from 1939 (with Hubert H. Cowell); and the Town Planning
				                            Institute (with Dean Berry). He also served on both Commonwealth and
				                            State government advisory committees, including the Canberra Siting
				                            Review Committee, the SA Town Planning Committee and the SA Planning
				                            Appeal Board.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; </description>

				                            record of research and commercialisation in the fields of thin film
				                            coatings, biomaterial science and life science tools research. He
				                            studied Chemistry (BSc) and Physical Chemistry (PhD) at the University
				                            of Durham (UK) and joined the University of Sheffield in 1988, where he
				                            held the Chair of Material and Biomaterial Chemistry from 2001. During
				                            this period, he was a founder Director of two University spin-out
				                            companies. He was appointed Director of the Mawson Institute, University
				                            of South Australia in 2006, and in 2008 he joined the ARC College of
				                            Experts (2008-10). He has held positions on several Boards and on
				                            Scientific Advisory Groups. Rob’s principal research field is plasma
				                            polymerization. He hopes that his work in this field has contributed to
				                            a better understanding the multi-facetted processes that lead to thin
				                            film growth from low temperature plasma. Studies have involved the
				                            application of mass spectrometry and novel electrostatic probes. In 1992
				                            he was awarded the CR Burch Prize for outstanding work in Physical
				                            Chemistry for Thin Films or Vacuum.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; </description>

         <description type="brief" xml:lang="en">This dataset comprises all available de-identified data for participants and groupings as well as the baseline and post-intervention testing of dexterity (Purdue Pegboard, Grooved Pegboard Test, Grip-Lift test) and psychological measures (adapted Intrinsic Motivation Inventory).  This data is for a randomised controlled study investigating sensory awareness training and additional motor practice in scalpel skill learning on a podiatry student population.  This data has been extracted or calculated where required (i.e. outcomes for the grip-lift test must be extracted or calculated from the recorded lifts) but otherwise remains in raw form.  </description>

         <description type="full" xml:lang="en">The Cat Tracker project was a collaborative initiative to further the understanding of domestic cats and community views on their ownership, using a Citizen Science approach. Citizen Science research methodology sees scientists partner with the public to conduct scientific research. The project was made of two parts. The first part was a social survey which included sections relating to cat ownership, attachment to cats, participant demographics, general opinions on cats, and cat stories. The second part was a cat tracking study, where Global Positioning System tracking units and cat harnesses were given to cat owners to monitor their pet cat's movement for one week. This research helped to provide better understanding of cat management decisions by the community and inform cat management by local councils and state government. The project was conducted in partnership with researchers in Wellington, New Zealand and North Carolina, USA.</description>

         <description type="full" xml:lang="en">The objective of this task was that a test bed of modelling applications be developed collaboratively between the research partners and the key South Australian state agencies. These applications included models of catchment surface water runoff, a reservoir management model, and an irrigated crop water balance model. The applications test bed was not intended as a substitute for detailed catchment hydrology or groundwater projects. Instead this test bed of application models helped ensure that the downscaled projections were ready for wider end user applications in South Australia.</description>

         <description type="full">&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;These datasets are part of a collection involving experiments or data collected to investigate the influences of vegetation and soil texture on the nutrient concentrations and the concentration and character of organics present in catchment waters of drinking supply reservoir in the context of their treatability by conventional (coagulation, flocculation and disinfection) treatment processes. Water samples (runoff and subsurface) were collected from zero order catchments having distinct vegetative cover (Australian native vegetation, pine plantation, grasslands) and contrasting texture of the surface soil horizon. Surface water samples were also collected from the Myponga River and Myponga Reservoir. These datasets are provided by the University of South Australia (UniSA). All data in these datasets were collected as part of the Australian Research Council project, ARC Linkage-LP110200208.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>

         <description type="full">&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This dataset covers bromide concentration (mg/L), chloride concentration (mg/L), trihalomethane formation potential (ug/L) and the formation of constituent THM compounds (chloroform, bromo-dichloromethane, dibromo-chloromethane, bromoform) for water samples before and after alum treatment under standard conditions. The dataset is part of a collection involving experiments or data collected to investigate the influences of vegetation and soil texture on the nutrient concentrations and the concentration and character of organics present in catchment waters of drinking supply reservoir in the context of their treatability by conventional (coagulation, flocculation and disinfection) treatment processes. Water samples (runoff and subsurface) were collected from zero order catchments having distinct vegetative cover (Australian native vegetation, pine plantation, grasslands) and contrasting texture of the surface soil horizon. Surface water samples were also collected from the Myponga River and Myponga Reservoir. The data presented is the result of a laboratory scale based investigation using natural source water and does not reflect the water quality of product water from a full-scale drinking water treatment plant. This dataset is provided by the University of South Australia (UniSA). All data in this dataset was collected as part of the Australian Research Council project, ARC Linkage-LP110200208.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>

         <description type="full">&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This dataset covers pH, organics concentration (measured as dissolved organic carbon, mg/L) and organics characterization [UV absorbance @ 254 nm (cm-1) and colour @ 456 nm (Hazen unit)] for treated water samples by different alum doses. The dataset is part of a collection involving experiments or data collected to investigate the influences of vegetation and soil texture on the nutrient concentrations and the concentration and character of organics present in catchment waters of drinking supply reservoir in the context of their treatability by conventional (coagulation, flocculation and disinfection) treatment processes. Water samples (runoff and subsurface) were collected from zero order catchments having distinct vegetative cover (Australian native vegetation, pine plantation, grasslands) and contrasting texture of the surface soil horizon. Surface water samples were also collected from the Myponga River and Myponga Reservoir. The data presented is the result of a laboratory scale based investigation using natural source water and does not reflect the water quality of product water from a full-scale drinking water treatment plant. This dataset is provided by the University of South Australia (UniSA). All data in this dataset was collected as part of the Australian Research Council project, ARC Linkage-LP110200208.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>

The dataset is part of a collection involving experiments or data collected to investigate the influences of vegetation and soil texture on the nutrient concentrations and the concentration and character of organics present in catchment waters of drinking supply reservoir in the context of their treatability by conventional (coagulation, flocculation and disinfection) treatment processes. Water samples (runoff and subsurface) were collected from zero order catchments having distinct vegetative cover (Australian native vegetation, pine plantation, grasslands) and contrasting texture of the surface soil horizon. Surface water samples were also collected from the Myponga River and Myponga Reservoir. The data presented is the result of a field scale based investigation using natural source water and does not reflect the water quality of product water from a full-scale drinking water treatment plant. This dataset is provided by the University of South Australia (UniSA). All data in this dataset was collected as part of the Australian Research Council project, ARC Linkage-LP110200208.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>

         <description type="full">&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This dataset covers pH, turbidity (NTU), conductivity (uS/cm), organics concentration (measured as dissolved organic carbon, mg/L) and organics characterization [UV absorbance @ 254 nm (cm-1) and colour @ 456 nm (Hazen unit)]. The dataset is part of a collection involving experiments or data collected to investigate the influences of vegetation and soil texture on the nutrient concentrations and the concentration and character of organics present in catchment waters of drinking supply reservoir in the context of their treatability by conventional (coagulation, flocculation and disinfection) treatment processes. Water samples (runoff and subsurface) were collected from zero order catchments having distinct vegetative cover (Australian native vegetation, pine plantation, grasslands) and contrasting texture of the surface soil horizon. Surface water samples were also collected from the Myponga River and Myponga Reservoir. The data presented is the result of a field scale based investigation using natural source water and does not reflect the water quality of product water from a full-scale drinking water treatment plant. This dataset is provided by the University of South Australia (UniSA). All data in this dataset was collected as part of the Australian Research Council project, ARC Linkage-LP110200208.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>

         <description type="full">&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This dataset covers the characterization of organics measured by fluorescence spectroscopy. This dataset includes the fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (F-EEM) spectra for water samples before and after alum treatment. The dataset is part of a collection involving experiments or data collected to investigate the influences of vegetation and soil texture on the nutrient concentrations and the concentration and character of organics present in catchment waters of drinking supply reservoir in the context of their treatability by conventional (coagulation, flocculation and disinfection) treatment processes. Water samples (runoff and subsurface) were collected from zero order catchments having distinct vegetative cover (Australian native vegetation, pine plantation, grasslands) and contrasting texture of the surface soil horizon. Surface water samples were also collected from the Myponga River and Myponga Reservoir. The data presented is the result of a laboratory scale based investigation using natural source water and does not reflect the water quality of product water from a full-scale drinking water treatment plant. This dataset is provided by the University of South Australia (UniSA). All data in this dataset was collected as part of the Australian Research Council project, ARC Linkage-LP110200208.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>

         <description type="full" xml:lang="en">This project aims to develop a catchment management decision support model (CMDSM) that enables determination of the impacts of land-use on water resources within catchments and links water quality to treatability at treatment plants. This will be done by generation of multidisciplinary data of representative, and contrasting sub-catchments to elucidate relationships between key catchment features such as geochemistry, topography, soils and land-use with climate, water quality and treatability. The CMDSM will enable improved short and long-term planning of catchment management that secures water resources.  Specific developments include concept models and mathematical modelling approaches for prediction of water quality and treatability</description>

         <description type="brief" xml:lang="en">This collates all information on metropolitan water mains in South Australia. The information includes the pipe material, the year the pipe was laid, and the pipe diameter. 
				SA Water's in-service pipes provide water to the consumer. Construction began in 1856 and has since expanded continuously with the increasing population and area expansion. To date, SA Water provides water to almost 700,000 customer water meters via approximately 27,000km of pipe network. This information collated on the pipe network of the South Australian Water Corporation (SA Water) has been provisioned from its Pipe Asset Register, the corporation's GIS (Geographic Information System).

         <description type="full" xml:lang="en">South Australia has unique water quality challenges, limited rainfall, and our population is spread across a large area, treating and transporting water is difficult. South Australia's water sources include: the River Murray, surface water, seawater and groundwater.
				Water quality is much more than just how water looks, tastes and smells (though these are important). It is also an issue of public health.
				Keeping the quality of our water consistent as it moves through our water mains is no simple feat. SA Water manages 42 water treatment plants. These plants remove impurities, filter the water and disinfect it so it is safe to drink.

         <description type="brief" xml:lang="en">SA Water looks after 27,000 kilometres of pipeline across Adelaide and throughout the state to deliver safe, clean water to South Australian households and businesses. SA Water is performing regular maintenance and replacing ageing pipes all over the year. SA Water wants to reduce the impact of bursts and leaks on our community and deliver a reliable service to their customers. Scheduled maintenance needs to be informed to customers as well as people passing through the site. This data provides the services carried out in the past.</description>
         <description type="brief" xml:lang="en">Major Faults include three fault types:                                                                                                                                                                                Burst: Water erupting or gushing from the ground. Usually found on, or near a road (however, some pipes run through open public spaces and private land).
				Major Leak: Visible leaks coming from the road surface (not metal access plates) on main roads only, including all roads in Adelaide's CBD and North Adelaide.
				Water Off: Often this will be because SA Water turned the water supply off to allow crews to mend damaged pipes - water supply disruptions often follow a major burst.</description>

The reservoirs don't just fill with rain, SA Water can use as storage to River Murray water to help meet customer demand. Types of data provided include the capacity, volume and rainfall levels of reservoirs. 
				At full capacity, SA Water has 10 reservoirs for metropolitan water supply to nearly 700,000 customers. The reservoir can hold almost 200,000 mega liters (ML) of water . This equates to just under a year's supply for metropolitan Adelaide.</description>

         <description type="full" xml:lang="en">The project is part of the national Industry-academic exchange program for water recycling. The project developed and applied energy benchmarking successfully employed for optimising wastewater treatment options to water recycling systems. The project integrated public health, energy and environmental considerations in a bid to make water recycling operations more energy efficient by optimising their management and operation. The benchmarking method was trialled on three full-scale South Australian water recycling systems, resulting in the identification of a number of optimisation opportunities.</description>
