This project aims to clarify the mechanism of power losses in magnetic cores used in the petrol-electric hybrid cars by investigating the relationship between the core losses and magnetic correlation lengths in iron alloys. This project expects to generate new knowledge on the effect of magneto-mechanical interaction on the anomalous core loss in iron based alloys. The intended outcomes include an experimental confirmation of the random anisotropy model, a major theoretical model in nanostructured materials and identification of ideal magnetic domain configurations for lower power losses. These intended outcomes should bring great benefits to the development of low-carbon vehicle technologies for sustainable motorisation in Australia.","funding-current":null,"funding-at-announcement":339099,"investigators-current":[],"investigators-at-announcement":[{"title":"Prof","firstName":"Kiyonori","familyName":"Suzuki","roleName":"Chief Investigator","roleCode":"CI","isFellowship":false,"orcidIdentifier":"0000-0002-8659-6786 "}],"organisations-current":[],"organisations-at-announcement":[{"organisationName":"Monash University","roleName":"Administering Organisation","state":"VIC"},{"organisationName":"Toyota Motor Corporation (Japan)","roleName":"Partner Organisation","state":null}],"field-of-research":[{"isPrimary":false,"code":"020404","name":"Electronic and Magnetic Properties of Condensed Matter; Superconductivity","type":"FOR08"},{"isPrimary":true,"code":"0912","name":"Materials Engineering","type":"FOR08"},{"isPrimary":false,"code":"091205","name":"Functional Materials","type":"FOR08"},{"isPrimary":false,"code":"091207","name":"Metals and Alloy Materials","type":"FOR08"}],"socio-economic-objective":[{"code":"850702","name":"Energy Conservation and Efficiency In Transport","type":"SEO08"},{"code":"889802","name":"Management of Greenhouse Gas Emissions From Transport Activities","type":"SEO08"}],"international-collaboration":["Japan"],"lief-register":[],"achievement-summary":null}}}
