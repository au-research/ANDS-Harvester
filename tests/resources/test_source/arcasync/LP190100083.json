There is an urgent need for new antiparasitics to treat multi-drug resistant livestock infections. This project aims to explore the bacteria and fungi present in the microbiomes of heavily infected sheep faeces and pastures, challenging them with environmental cues, including those from associated parasites, to stimulate production of defensive chemicals hidden deep within their genomes. Enabled by an integrated pipeline of high throughput analytical cultivation, molecular networking, and chemical and biological analyses, expected outcomes include an enhanced ability to explore and exploit valuable chemistry hidden within microbial genomes, leading to the discovery of new classes of natural antiparasitic to safeguard livestock.\n","funding-current":null,"funding-at-announcement":630000,"investigators-current":[],"investigators-at-announcement":[{"title":"Prof","firstName":"Robert","familyName":"Capon","roleName":"Chief Investigator","roleCode":"CI","isFellowship":false,"orcidIdentifier":"0000-0002-8341-7754 "},{"title":"Dr","firstName":"Zeinab","familyName":"Khalil","roleName":"Chief Investigator","roleCode":"CI","isFellowship":false,"orcidIdentifier":"0000-0002-9285-1720 "},{"title":"Dr","firstName":"Kim","familyName":"Agnew","roleName":"Partner Investigator","roleCode":"PI","isFellowship":false,"orcidIdentifier":"0000-0001-6983-9275 "}],"organisations-current":[],"organisations-at-announcement":[{"organisationName":"The University of Queensland","roleName":"Administering Organisation","state":"QLD"},{"organisationName":"BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM PTY LTD","roleName":"Partner Organisation","state":null}],"field-of-research":[{"isPrimary":true,"code":"0305","name":"Organic Chemistry","type":"FOR08"},{"isPrimary":false,"code":"030502","name":"Natural Products Chemistry","type":"FOR08"},{"isPrimary":false,"code":"070205","name":"Animal Protection (Pests and Pathogens)","type":"FOR08"}],"socio-economic-objective":[{"code":"860701","name":"Animal Protection Chemicals","type":"SEO08"}],"international-collaboration":["Germany","United States of America"],"lief-register":[],"achievement-summary":null}}}
