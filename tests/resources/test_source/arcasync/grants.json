This project aims to build a new workflow for improving resource exploration evaluation by Australian companies and applied to three practical industry cases in frontier basins. The expected outcomes of this proposal are: detailed risk analysis of oil and gas prospectivity in frontier basins onshore and offshore Australia; a new strategic collaboration between Australian industry, government and universities; students trained in advanced computational methods suitable for the evolving Australian oil and gas industry; and a software product that has high commericalisation potential. The project will transfer knowledge from European industry and universities to Australia and has applications for mineral prospectivity in sedimentary basins.

In a natural gas wells, sucker rod guides protect the production tubing from wear by the rod string. Premature and erratic failures are costing the industry tens of millions every year. In collaboration with two local SMEs, this project aims to develop the next generation of smart and durable wear guides. The project seeks to understand the complex three body wear mechanisms that drive guide and tubing wear, then use this knowledge to develop new wear resistant compounds and develop a smart guide that provides feedback on its wear state. This will enable the industry partners to supply cutting edge technology to the global oil and gas industry that not only reduces well operation cost but also enhances well resilience.","lead-investigator":"Dr Michael Heitzmann","current-funding-amount":480295.0,"announced-funding-amount":480295,"grant-status":"Not yet accepted","primary-field-of-research":"0912 - Materials Engineering","anticipated-end-date":"","investigators":"","lief-register":[]},"links":{"self":"https://dataportal.arc.gov.au/NCGP/API/grants/LP190100191"}},{"type":"grants","id":"LP190100216","attributes":{"code":"LP190100216","scheme-name":"Linkage Projects","funding-commencement-year":2020,"scheme-information":{"schemeCode":"LP","program":"Linkage","submissionYear":2019,"roundNumber":1,"schemeRound":"LP19 Round 1"},"current-admin-organisation":"Queensland University of Technology","announcement-admin-organisation":"Queensland University of Technology","grant-summary":"Achieving gender equality in STEMM hospital and health service research. This project addresses the crucial and vexed question of why gender inequality remains pervasive and persistent in Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics and Medicine (STEMM) workforces, despite substantial and wide-ranging efforts to effect change. Specifically, it examines the systemic causes of gender inequality in hospital and health research environments, a highly under-researched area of national significance. The project will result in critically-informed, pragmatic strategies that enable health service organisations to detect and redress gender inequality. The research advances inclusive and effective STEMM workforces and, ultimately, world-leading health research practice and gender equality in Australia.","lead-investigator":"A/Prof Robyn Mayes","current-funding-amount":251442.0,"announced-funding-amount":251442,"grant-status":"Not yet accepted","primary-field-of-research":"1699 - Other Studies In Human Society","anticipated-end-date":"","investigators":"","lief-register":[]},"links":{"self":"https://dataportal.arc.gov.au/NCGP/API/grants/LP190100216"}}]}
