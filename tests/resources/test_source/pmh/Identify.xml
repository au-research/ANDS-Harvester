DRO is Deakin University's institutional digital repository for publications, 
research, and teaching materials. Deposited material covers a very wide range of subjects and disciplines. 
The repository holds the full text of many peer-reviewed published articles and conference papers, as well 
as book chapters, theses and other forms of written research from DU academic staff and 
postgraduate students. It contains working and discussion papers, technical reports and some preprints. 
Research datasets, sound and image collections, multimedia, software and other forms of research data are 
also held. Learning objects and other course-related materials are welcome.

        <metadataPolicy >
          <text>DRO metadata are freely accessible to all, and freely re-useable 
by all, under the following conditions: (1) The full name(s) of the 
author(s) and (2) the full bibliographic reference information for 
the paper (date, title, and, if published, publisher, if any, full 
name of journal or conference proceedings, volume, issue/number and 
pages, if any) must always co-appear prominently with any re-use or 
redisplay of the metadata, in any medium. The metadata may not be 
offered for sale without the formal permission of the author and 
publisher. (Note: DRO is NOT the publisher; it is merely the 
online archive that hosts the papers. Attribution of DRO when 
re-using any metadata is required.)

<submissionPolicy>
  <text>DRO is a repository for the self-archiving, by their 
authors (or, by authorised second parties, or, if the papers are in the 
public domain, by anyone), of research papers in any discipline by 
academic staff and postgraduate students of the . 
Papers can be (1) refereed, accepted, published final drafts (post-prints) 
or (2) unrefereed drafts prior to publication (pre-prints). Deposits will 
be vetted by DRO for provenance and completeness; they will not be 
otherwise validated or authenticated. Responsibility for the validity and 
authenticity of the content of these self-archived papers rests entirely 
with the depositor. Any copyright violations are also entirely the 
responsibility of the depositor. (DRO, if it receives proof of 
copyright violation, will immediately remove the paper in question.)
