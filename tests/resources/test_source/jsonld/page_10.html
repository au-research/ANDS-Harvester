It has been developed at the Research School of Earth Sciences of the Australian National University, as part of the AuScope\u2013AGOS Inversion Laboratory.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;REDBACK is deliberately designed to perform efficiently on personal computers, and is available for Unix (Linux and Mac OS) as well as for Windows. Its strengths are easiness of use and computational efficiency. Users include plate kinematicists, geodynamicists and, more in general, anyone making use of tectonic plate motions and their changes through geological time.&lt;\/p&gt;"],"identifier":[{"@type":"PropertyValue","propertyID":"URL","value":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/(DoI to be minted)"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","propertyID":"URL","value":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/to be minted"}],"url":"https:\/\/demo.ands.org.au\/redback\/1274023"}</script>
