The ability to execute and learn skillful actions deteriorates with advancing age, but the cause remains elusive.

The research will use multimodal approaches to reveal the causal role of age-related changes in specific brain networks to motor behaviour and learning.

From everyday activities like riding a bicycle or carrying on a conversation to the extraordinary achievements of top artists, athletes, and thinkers, skill permeates human life and defines its possibilities.

This project intends to explore the connections between political programs promoting social change and cultural and commercial activities in China since 1900. It intends to generate new knowledge about the factors that influence people’s perceptions of desirable male and female behaviours by examining the evolution of ideals of beauty and ugliness and how they are used by political, cultural or commercial actors. The expected outcomes include deepening Australia’s knowledge of what constitutes a positive or negative attribute in the Chinese marketplace (both the commercial market of products and the political market of ideas) and enabling Australians to promote their products/ideas more effectively in the global powerhouse that is China.","lead-investigator":"Prof Louise Edwards","current-funding-amount":141988.00,"announced-funding-amount":140128,"grant-status":"Active","primary-field-of-research":"2103 - Historical Studies","anticipated-end-date":"2022-12-31","investigators":"Prof Louise Edwards","lief-register":[]},"links":{"self":"https://dataportal.arc.gov.au/NCGP/API/grants/DP200101324"}},{"type":"grants","id":"DE200100778","attributes":{"code":"DE200100778","scheme-name":"Discovery Early Career Researcher Award","funding-commencement-year":2020,"scheme-information":{"schemeCode":"DE","program":"Discovery","submissionYear":2019,"roundNumber":1,"schemeRound":"DE20 Round 1"},"current-admin-organisation":"The University of Queensland","announcement-admin-organisation":"The University of Queensland","grant-summary":"Mapping the neural circuits that underlie emotional learning.

While the different systems of sex-determination—involving genetic or environmental control—are fairly well understood, transitions between these systems remain enigmatic in evolutionary biology. This project aims to address this gap by revealing the molecular change required to transition between systems, using one of only two known lizard species exhibiting both genetic and temperature control of sex. This knowledge will have important implications for species conservation, facilitating predictions of highly biased sex ratios under climate change, plus potential commercial applications for species where production of one sex is favoured.","lead-investigator":"A/Prof Erik Wapstra","current-funding-amount":414594.00,"announced-funding-amount":409121,"grant-status":"Active","primary-field-of-research":"0604 - Genetics","anticipated-end-date":"2022-12-31","investigators":"A/Prof Erik Wapstra; Prof Tariq Ezaz; A/Prof Christopher Burridge; Asst Prof Oleg Simakov","lief-register":[]},"links":{"self":"https://dataportal.arc.gov.au/NCGP/API/grants/DP200101406"}},{"type":"grants","id":"DE200100800","attributes":{"code":"DE200100800","scheme-name":"Discovery Early Career Researcher Award","funding-commencement-year":2020,"scheme-information":{"schemeCode":"DE","program":"Discovery","submissionYear":2019,"roundNumber":1,"schemeRound":"DE20 Round 1"},"current-admin-organisation":"The University of Queensland","announcement-admin-organisation":"The University of Queensland","grant-summary":"Legume meristem signalling peptides: an untapped niche.

The project aims to develop a framework to apply mixed reality technologies in education, by fusing the information with human physical, physiological, cognitive and emotional perceptions. The current approach translates existing contents into 3D which does not scale and causes cognitive overload. The project conceptually advances the design and development of mixed reality applications. The expected outcome is a mixed reality integration framework for effective communication, applicable to manufacturing, health, tourism and arts. The benefits are enhanced learning with engaging resources, with positive impact on student learning outcomes and motivation, in both formal and informal education settings such as schools, galleries, and museums.","lead-investigator":"Dr Thuong Hoang","current-funding-amount":427181.00,"announced-funding-amount":421979,"grant-status":"Active","primary-field-of-research":"0806 - Information Systems","anticipated-end-date":"2023-01-28","investigators":"Dr Thuong Hoang","lief-register":[]},"links":{"self":"https://dataportal.arc.gov.au/NCGP/API/grants/DE200100898"}},{"type":"grants","id":"DP200101737","attributes":{"code":"DP200101737","scheme-name":"Discovery Projects","funding-commencement-year":2020,"scheme-information":{"schemeCode":"DP","program":"Discovery","submissionYear":2019,"roundNumber":1,"schemeRound":"DP20 Round 1"},"current-admin-organisation":"University of South Australia","announcement-admin-organisation":"University of South Australia","grant-summary":"A Novel Approach to Polymer/Nanosheet Composites and Their Fundamentals. Multifunctional Polymer/nanosheet composites have not yet been widely scaled up in polymer processing and composite industries mainly due to cost and inhaling hazard.

While the outline of this synchronisation hierarchy is known, many questions remain about exactly which primitive groups lie in which layers.

Expected outcomes are benchmark experimental data on structural behaviour under sustained loads, development of reliable simulation models and robust design procedures for the control of time-dependent cracking and deformation in fibre reinforced concrete, with reduced maintenance costs and more sustainable concrete structures.","lead-investigator":"Em/Prof Raymond Gilbert","current-funding-amount":411161.00,"announced-funding-amount":405000,"grant-status":"Active","primary-field-of-research":"0905 - Civil Engineering","anticipated-end-date":"2022-12-31","investigators":"Dr Ali Amin; Em/Prof Raymond Gilbert","lief-register":[]},"links":{"self":"https://dataportal.arc.gov.au/NCGP/API/grants/DP200102114"}},{"type":"grants","id":"DE200101019","attributes":{"code":"DE200101019","scheme-name":"Discovery Early Career Researcher Award","funding-commencement-year":2020,"scheme-information":{"schemeCode":"DE","program":"Discovery","submissionYear":2019,"roundNumber":1,"schemeRound":"DE20 Round 1"},"current-admin-organisation":"Monash University","announcement-admin-organisation":"Monash University","grant-summary":"Mechanisms determining ecological resilience to climate change.

This project aims to understand how gene interactions impact evolution in our warming marine environments. The role of gene interactions is controversial because they are assumed to have little effect on genetic variation for fitness in natural populations.

The project aims to use quantitative genetics, genomics, and theory to determine the evolutionary impacts on marine populations facing rapid ocean warming in southeast Australia. The outcomes could change how we view gene interactions, and help us to better predict biological responses to environmental change.","lead-investigator":"Dr Keyne Monro","current-funding-amount":386222.00,"announced-funding-amount":381074,"grant-status":"Active","primary-field-of-research":"0603 - Evolutionary Biology","anticipated-end-date":"2022-12-31","investigators":"Dr Keyne Monro; Dr Kathryn Hodgins","lief-register":[]},"links":{"self":"https://dataportal.arc.gov.au/NCGP/API/grants/DP200102214"}},{"type":"grants","id":"DP200102224","attributes":{"code":"DP200102224","scheme-name":"Discovery Projects","funding-commencement-year":2020,"scheme-information":{"schemeCode":"DP","program":"Discovery","submissionYear":2019,"roundNumber":1,"schemeRound":"DP20 Round 1"},"current-admin-organisation":"Monash University","announcement-admin-organisation":"Monash University","grant-summary":"Global dementias: Examining structural vulnerability and dementia outcomes.

We have discovered novel small molecules that prevent the fibrils from forming. This project will use these molecules to reveal the details of the fibril assembly mechanism and find the best way to undermine this fungal defence system.

T cells provide critical immune protection against infection and cancer. However, the pathways that regulate these immune cells are not fully understood.

In this proposal, we reveal new evidence that this molecule is an unappreciated and crucial regulator of T cell behaviour. Using state-of-the-art techniques and novel genetic tools, this project aims to discover the involvement of S1P5 in the immune response, and determine how S1P5 can be controlled to enhance protective T cell immunity.
