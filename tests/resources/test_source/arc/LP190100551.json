Australia's climate transition will have to drastically cut our national emissions. Yet our transition also needs to be fair. This project will develop a social justice framework for the implementation of a zero net emissions climate transition for rural Victoria. This will be the first comprehensive incorporation of social justice framework with detailed mitigation strategies for rural Australia.  The research will combine insights from leading Australian and international energy groups and current research to produce valuable inputs into a national just transitions strategy and provide benefits to Industry partners and the sector. The project will significantly contribute to our understanding of a just climate transition.","funding-current":null,"funding-at-announcement":191374,"investigators-current":[],"investigators-at-announcement":[{"title":"Prof","firstName":"Jeremy","familyName":"Moss","roleName":"Chief Investigator","roleCode":"CI","isFellowship":false,"orcidIdentifier":null},{"title":"Prof","firstName":"Greg","familyName":"Marston","roleName":"Chief Investigator","roleCode":"CI","isFellowship":false,"orcidIdentifier":null},{"title":"Mr","firstName":"Rob","familyName":"Law","roleName":"Partner Investigator","roleCode":"PI","isFellowship":false,"orcidIdentifier":null},{"title":"Mr","firstName":"Damien","familyName":"Moyse","roleName":"Partner Investigator","roleCode":"PI","isFellowship":false,"orcidIdentifier":null},{"title":"Mr","firstName":"SÃ¸ren","familyName":"Hermansen","roleName":"Partner Investigator","roleCode":"PI","isFellowship":false,"orcidIdentifier":null}],"organisations-current":[],"organisations-at-announcement":[{"organisationName":"The University of New South Wales","roleName":"Administering Organisation","state":"NSW"},{"organisationName":"Hepburn Wind","roleName":"Partner Organisation","state":null},{"organisationName":"Renew Australia","roleName":"Partner Organisation","state":null},{"organisationName":"Little Sketches","roleName":"Partner Organisation","state":null},{"organisationName":"Samso Energy Academy","roleName":"Partner Organisation","state":null},{"organisationName":"The University of Queensland","roleName":"Other Eligible Organisation","state":"QLD"},{"organisationName":"Central Victorian Greenhouse Alliance Incorporated","roleName":"Partner Organisation","state":null}],"field-of-research":[{"isPrimary":true,"code":"2201","name":"Applied Ethics","type":"FOR08"},{"isPrimary":false,"code":"220199","name":"Applied Ethics Not Elsewhere Classified","type":"FOR08"},{"isPrimary":false,"code":"220305","name":"Ethical Theory","type":"FOR08"}],"socio-economic-objective":[{"code":"950403","name":"Environmental Ethics","type":"SEO08"},{"code":"950407","name":"Social Ethics","type":"SEO08"}],"international-collaboration":["Denmark"],"lief-register":[],"achievement-summary":null}}}
