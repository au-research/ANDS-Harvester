Because flow and mixing is critical to industry and advanced research processes that develop new materials, a facility is needed that allows the same careful study of material structure with the addition of controlled flow. We will build such facilities, enabling study of high-speed, stretching, and other complex flows, matching applied processes and giving Australia the lead in their study.","lead-investigator":"A/Prof Patrick Spicer","current-funding-amount":320000.00,"announced-funding-amount":320000,"grant-status":"Active","primary-field-of-research":"0306 - Physical Chemistry (Incl.

This will reduce the stress that causes mechanical failure, while increasing chemical stability so that the latest generation of high-power electrodes can be brought into service.","lead-investigator":"Prof Chris Ling","current-funding-amount":515975.00,"announced-funding-amount":510000,"grant-status":"Active","primary-field-of-research":"0302 - Inorganic Chemistry","anticipated-end-date":"2023-01-31","investigators":"Prof Chris Ling; Dr Neeraj Sharma; Dr Maxim Avdeev","lief-register":[]},"links":{"self":"https://dataportal.arc.gov.au/NCGP/API/grants/DP200100959"}},{"type":"grants","id":"DP200100961","attributes":{"code":"DP200100961","scheme-name":"Discovery Projects","funding-commencement-year":2020,"scheme-information":{"schemeCode":"DP","program":"Discovery","submissionYear":2019,"roundNumber":1,"schemeRound":"DP20 Round 1"},"current-admin-organisation":"The University of Melbourne","announcement-admin-organisation":"The University of Melbourne","grant-summary":"Discovering genes for singing ability in Australian families. Music abilities are core to what makes us human, with singing ubiquitous in all cultures. Anecdotal evidence suggests that singing ability runs in families, supporting its genetic basis, however no research has systematically traced it across generations. Using an innovative web-based singing program and the latest molecular genetic techniques, this project aims to discover singing ability genes through the first Australian study of large families with many talented singers. This will generate new knowledge on the origins of human musicality and help Australia develop a sustainable source of cultural capital. It will build interdisciplinary research capacity and inform bespoke music learning programs that account for individual differences.","lead-investigator":"Prof Sarah Wilson","current-funding-amount":544664.00,"announced-funding-amount":539394,"grant-status":"Active","primary-field-of-research":"1701 - Psychology","anticipated-end-date":"2022-12-31","investigators":"Prof Isabelle Peretz; Prof Sarah Wilson; Prof Samuel Berkovic; Prof Gary McPherson","lief-register":[]},"links":{"self":"https://dataportal.arc.gov.au/NCGP/API/grants/DP200100961"}},{"type":"grants","id":"DP200100963","attributes":{"code":"DP200100963","scheme-name":"Discovery Projects","funding-commencement-year":2020,"scheme-information":{"schemeCode":"DP","program":"Discovery","submissionYear":2019,"roundNumber":1,"schemeRound":"DP20 Round 1"},"current-admin-organisation":"The University of New South Wales","announcement-admin-organisation":"The University of New South Wales","grant-summary":"The physics and art of expressive performance on wind instruments.

Heat transfer dictates the efficiency of energy and transport systems such as gas turbines, high-speed generators and turbochargers.

This project therefore aims to advance our fundamental understanding of heat transfer accounting for the practical surface conditions of roughness, solid-fluid pairing and uneven heating. Building on capabilities that now place systematic data within reach, this project will deliver physics-based models that can robustly predict heat transfer, leading to reduced costs of energy and transport.","lead-investigator":"A/Prof Daniel Chung","current-funding-amount":339294.00,"announced-funding-amount":335000,"grant-status":"Active","primary-field-of-research":"0915 - Interdisciplinary Engineering","anticipated-end-date":"2022-12-31","investigators":"Prof Dr Detlef Lohse; A/Prof Daniel Chung; Prof Nicholas Hutchins","lief-register":[]},"links":{"self":"https://dataportal.arc.gov.au/NCGP/API/grants/DP200100969"}},{"type":"grants","id":"DP200100972","attributes":{"code":"DP200100972","scheme-name":"Discovery Projects","funding-commencement-year":2020,"scheme-information":{"schemeCode":"DP","program":"Discovery","submissionYear":2019,"roundNumber":1,"schemeRound":"DP20 Round 1"},"current-admin-organisation":"Griffith University","announcement-admin-organisation":"Griffith University","grant-summary":"Persuading tourists to use fewer natural resources when on holidays.
