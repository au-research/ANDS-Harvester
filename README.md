ANDS-Harvester
==============

The Harvester Service provides a service-oriented framework to support the processing and routing of content and metadata from a source Data Provider to a target application. It potentially makes management of distributed harvests simpler by providing a single harvest application which can service many clients wishing to perform harvesting without the overhead of writing their own embedded harvester.
